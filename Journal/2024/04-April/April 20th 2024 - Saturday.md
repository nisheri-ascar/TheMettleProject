8:36 AM

The amount of focus i had yesterday night, caffeine nap (to be linked) was just the best body hack i ever did. That flow state is what i desired for long, to be totally absorbed in your work. Its what i always wanted.

1:50 PM

Man this fucking sucks as hell. I lost my entries once again more, AAAAAAAAAA i want to kill myself

6:06 PM

My mind is absolutely chaotic and all of my ideas and plans are colliding to each other. So i will write it here to keep myself sane

- ~~Devuan~~ Migrating to Void Linux
- [x] Installing GTA SA
- [ ] Grabbing old memory files and restoring most pictures i need

## Migrating to Void Linux
It occured to my [[Internal Distractions]] that i need to migrate this poor laptop to a systemd free linux distro, this poor thing has only 2GB of RAM and systemd takes 200MB! What a waste of resources! Void Linux uses Runit (to be linked later) which is an extremely lightweight init system, it probably takes less than 20 MB. Systemd + KDE is already hell for this thing. If i want to keep this thing running like new i'd need to do it. I need to be really careful about the files as i want to make it feel as if there's nothing have changed. In the other account in this laptop they have customized it well for their needs.

The plan is to:

- Create a small partition (roughly 5GB)
- Install Void there
- Do some customizations
- if everything feels good and alright, resize partition then migrate
- done!

8:44 PM 

Currently doing the recovering memory part, but i already installed GTA btw!

Such nostalgia, it performs really well for this potato.


Recovering the memory will be painful i'm sure..

i have, so many, pics, of her. my god.
Just how many? How many? Christ.
I feel like i'm mentally detoriating right now, but i need to keep up

An unformidable pain is occuring in my chest, a pain so terrible it makes me want to vomit.
I want to cry everything. What kind of a fool i am.
I was such an embecile brat that never had a values on anything, the saying "you'll understand the value of things when you drop it" hits harder than i expected. It hurts. It hurts to see my past self being happy wasting everything, a dumb idiot.

Ahh, an idiot who lived the worse of his delusions, what a crappy kid.





![[2022_02_23_18.24.25.png]]

i had, friends? what? im literally crying right now.
i cant remember i had friends during pandemic, what the hell. this image was the last image i wanted to see. I'm suffering so bad, this was the worse i had, all these time, i've been suffering, consuming all of these suffering alone. I'm so alone, god i'm alone. im crying

AW HELL NAHHH AHSHASHASHASH mygod

i missed this, peak.


11:18 PM 

I found myself in spiral of emotions, emotions that i have once again unlocked after it frozed into obscurity, only to be found out again by none other than me.

I have so many regrets in my life.

I need to kill my ego.


Being a teenager is hard, not by any physical means, but psychologically. Having an emotion swing brought by developing brain, struggling for acceptance and desiring control, thats me. Its part of growing up. But its really hard, and i need to do something about it.

https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-control-my-emotions-as-a-teenager i need to research and write some notes regarding of this teenage emotional rebellion or somethinh, and utilize those informations to have control of myself. 

> my personal tip: find an outlet.
   Being a teenager is rough on the ol' emotions, and the hormones can start to get overwhelming. That's why it is critical to find an outlet, something that relieves the stress and let's your mind cool off. For me, it's drawing. Anytime I feel fed up or angry, I just sit and draw in a sketchbook. I also like to hit a punching bag when I'm really, really furious. Whatever it is for you, just find something to help you cope with the flood of emotions that comes with being a teen. Music, art, literature... it's different for everyone.


Then its a perfect reason to make an outlet of arts, music and programming. If i ran out or lose the meaning of learning arts, i want to remind myself that this is the healthy outlet i only have. 

11:47 PM

From now on, i'm gonna commit myself to consistency. To be consistent being a better person, to be not a dickhead, to control my emotions, to have a skills that i can cope into.

I need to fix my emotions before i can hop back into changing my values, my emotions has always been the sole reason i cant move forward.
