- A strange dream

This night, i just had the most strangest dream yet again. I dreamed about being with shanie again. The feeling of extreme euphoria and a feeling i cant explain shows just how fucked up my views about her. It has been hardcoded in my beliefs. Its stated in [[Atomic Habits]] that I can indeed change my personality by changing my beliefs because personality just means "repeated selfness", we can change our beliefs and our beliefs to ourselves by starting and be consistent about it. That way we have a proof that we can tell ourselves *we are that kind of person.* 

I need to get out in my belief love is absolute peak of happiness, **i can prove that it isn't just love that makes you happy, but on the hobbies and job is the one that makes you truly happy**

It was such a joyful moment for me when i finally learned how to ride the horse. I was succumbed with anxiety that things would fail, but it was proven once again that [[January 6th 2024 - Saturday#^7836f3 |joyful things in our lives are in the other side of our fear.]] 

Unfortunately, Petra (the horse) will be taken by the original owner. Tito Anthony who's originally the owner of the horse will take her. My father said his reasoning were vague, but i knew the answer. It was because Petra was too thin under our care, which i don't even wanna deny i don't know how to to take care of a horse in first place. Hell even my father don't know how to take care of one. But i tried my best to give all the care i have to take care the horse. It was the best of the best i had. Unluckily, its a hellish dry month and i swear its been a month it didn't rain so the grass didn't regrow anymore. But i do understand the sentiment of my Tito Anthony though. he just cares with the horse. Thats all

But eh, Petra's daughter Spirit will be left behind to our care. I'll try my best to take care of her. And hopefully ride her someday.

two things i have learned from today btw:

1. Horses don't like surprises.
	 Horses are quite anxious and agressive when they're touched outta nowhere or something. Petra don't like being rode with bare bodylifting, it must have some sort of easy way to ride them (thats why saddle exists! So both the rider and the horse becomes comfortable!)
2. Horses can be trained with rewarding system
	 I mean, all animals, and even humans can be trained with rewarding, thats just the nature of everything. But in horse' case i can train them with salt (and maybe other things?)
