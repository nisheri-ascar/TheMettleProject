I woke up with no delusion in mind after being focused last night, this must be the effect yet my threat signals are waving

I need to get used to this, this will be the normal if i keep focusing and do work.

I am so fucking pissed that i lost what i wrote in this entry, it fucking makes me want to kill anybody i encounter. Many minutes of focus and imagination down to drain. Man this is so fucking unmotivating.

There's alot of things happening inside my head at this moment, i want to die, i want to cry. gosh pls take me already.

Going to past, going to future, i can't  make myself home in present. I feel so out of space, out from this reality

I chatted Gelbert this night, i sent him a random link of free canvas pro. It was convenient. In our conversation he feels more softer than usual. It made me wonder why, but it's better I guess. Maybe that's the way he shows his affection. Or maybe he planted hatred on me. But, does it really matter what he thinks? What matters is, i'm in the present, deal with what's in the present. And what's in the present? [[El Filibusterismo - Ikalawang Kabanata]] writing. I need to make the powerpoint now.
