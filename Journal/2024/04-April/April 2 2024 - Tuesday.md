Can't get my head off on the thought she might actually not be straight. All of my dreams are just a mere delusion. 

This is the problem when people depend their happiness and external materialistic things, such as a person.

I myself, and i am completely aware that i am depending on Shanie. Because that's what i did before and it works so well, she was the reason i hopped to programming. 

9:43 AM
It made me think sometimes, i wanted to be a busy person. While i did achieve it back then, i have forgotten it nowadays. 

what i always wanted to be was to be entirely away from distractions and be a better person overall. 

What i'm doing is creepy it's just plain obsession at this point, this isn't love.

it would be really nice to tell what she really feels unfortunately we are barriered with this so cruel societal hierarchy. we are limited from our flesh our physical forms all materialistic views we have in this world. 

Why can't we just communicate directly with the consciousness to consciousness directly? 

but i guess that rains the fun part of what these physical barriers give us after all our happiness is based upon solving problems solving small things such as trying to start a conversation with a friend or trying to get a friend of an interesting person to you. 

our consciousness is wrapped around with this soft tissues protected by a skull, and that skull is wrapped with flesh for appearance. 

we aren't truly conscious we are living in illusion of materialistic world via our senses eyes ears nose etc we can't live on actual reality or reality we can see the quantum properties of everything because as i mentioned we are limited our own senses. 

Maybe if our brains was conscious on its own we could see the quantum properties of everything with probably be a god. 

Ahh, i'm just trying to distract myself at this point from this reality i just really wish that i could read people's mind fuck this rules and whatever this world has set. 

Why can't i just be true to myself. 

for my name millions maybe billion girls i could have laid into my eyes into why her first trade 6 years have been obsessed with her i just cant. I just want to be with her. I want to do everything what you want i want to surprise her every time whether the sun event or it's her birthday. i really wish i could. 

If just not this freaking mental illness i have and the city deck of cards i have in my hands maybe maybe i had a chance that she was mine. maybe in future in another timeline we were married and had kids and became a happy family. 

I don't know. i don't know really. I know nothing. if maybe i was transferred back in grade nine here maybe i was the first place in her heart. 

Competition is already part of our nature. Naturally must competes with space. Light competes with darkness. In nature kingdom all species compete to survive, all shit like that.

And yet here i am competing with the lesbian. 

12:49 PM

Bipolar being bipolar again. I feel sad today i'll just let this pass by maybe i'm just hungry. i dunno.
i just want... no, i don't want to be happy. chasing for it is the worst thing i can do.

12:30 PM

"I wish" is what i i always tell to myself i always take action, but why? Things doesn't seem to work out.

It's like the world is against me. It feels like really, i'm getting tired. 
Ughhhh just want to sleep.

I wish i'd eventually woke up in another world. God.

9:30 PM

An intense happiness is swelling up inside me a butterfly it sounds ridiculous but i feel so happy that you replied on my messenger notes i feel so happy i feel so human maybe i really have a chance maybe more than 50% i don't know but what matter is that she acknowledges my feelings i want to turn down my intends delusions holy shit is eating me.
