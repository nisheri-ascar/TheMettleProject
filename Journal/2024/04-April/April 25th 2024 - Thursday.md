jesus fucking christ i look really really young in these pics, if i look like 30 back then now i look like an actual expected 16 years old.
It makes me realize i really need to take care of my physical appearance. Maybe the eyebags contributed to my look of being mature, but eh. Also my hair bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh i need to style my hair.

Besides that, its been day 2 since i deactivated all of my accounts. I'm sorry [[September 10 2023#Modern Problem Requires Modern Solution! |Kristofer from past]] but addiction on social media is really hard. Too unfortunate but its really the reason my attention span and my beliefs are fucked, social media is fucked in general. Staying away from it is far the good solution for long term.

I think i have a working reason why i cant sleep immediately, i think its because **i feel i didnt accomplished or finished a task**. Don't you just feel like you can't sleep because you hasn't finished i thing? i think thats what i feel. 
Soooo, i think i want to write atlease 50 words every night on [[01 - An encounter of an angel old|My Dearest Beloved Angel]], that way i can feel atlease some sort of accomplishment and then finally letting myself sleep. If that works then i might add it in [[Mind Hacking - How to change your mind in 21 days]] in order to repeat and prove that i must do it
