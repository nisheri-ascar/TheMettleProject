#Mind_hacking 

i noticed a thing when i listen to music, when i choose what music i want i immediately feel lost in my thought, i would feel like as if my brain was fuzzing out. But when i put it to shuffle mode and let it play whatever it wants i would feel fine. Maybe this is the reason why i become horrible person when i listen to music, because my [[Fixing My Attention Span For Good | attention span]] is fucked. Thus as a part of [[Mind Hacking - How to change your mind in 21 days |mind hacking]] i will repeat this everyday of restricting myself to listen only on shuffle, not picking anything else.

And fuck, i couldnt finish all of my assignments. they turned off all of their wifi and there was just no fucking way i could write. I wish i printed all of the questionaires or modules. Guess i'll figure it out tommorow.

Anyways as you might have noticed i made a new folder [[00 - Prologue |My Dearest Beloved Angel]]. Its my *hopefully* first serious novel i want to write. Its based on real events where the main character is me, and the girl will be shanie. The story revolves around a boy who is obsessed with a girl that obviously didn't like her, and thus this guy turns full yandere mode and kidnap shit like that. Hopefully catching and writing [[March 8 2024 - Yet Another Step Forward |this embarrasment]] and also [[February 14 2024 - Valentines day |this one..]] 

You might ask "what the fuck thats friendly fire, or self fire.." and it is. I want to write this embarrasment to express and wake myself up in reality. Its a form of revolting against myself. I'm gonna write it boldly as if i was walking in streets naked, thats how i'm going to write it.
