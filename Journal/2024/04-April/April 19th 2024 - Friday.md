Today wasn't a usual day as i expected, alot surely happened. 

So, starting in early morning. I was in aunt's house. I was ready to leave when I saw a strange van near the convenient store. It was really odd van that it got me thinking, who's inside? When i finally passed into its front windshield I saw a familiar face, a face so familliar that i haven't seen personally, but only on medias (TV, Social Media etc..). He was literally staring back to me dubiously, it was funny. The person was no other than *Atom Arollo*. A well known hot guy reporter in our country. He's masculine, tall and mature, literally a standard of any women. 
I walked while being flabbergasted, I saw someone really popular, right in front of my own eyes. It was something else really.

And other things happened in this day, i was initially planning to go in rafael's house to fix his locked IPhone, although he already sent it to some dicks in Valencia, so eh

^ Photo of his cat lol, its a breed of perusian something i forgot.

And then, he mentioned afterwards he got some performance task to do with his classmates. Phia was there so I had to. And then we went, i finally saw Phia once again, its pretty cool she finally had courage to show her face, she's quite a beauty not gonna lie (not to mention they're bff with shanie, *cough* *cough*). Anyways, this day was quite fun, it will be a core memory, unforunately I havent much taken pictures. Sucks.

I can really say [[Caffeine Nap]] is absolute steroids, its like i've unlocked new levels of focus. I can finally survive in senior high and college during night times.
