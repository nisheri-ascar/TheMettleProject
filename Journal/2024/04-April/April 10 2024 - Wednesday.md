[[Beating Procrastination]] tells about writing journal about your worries to ease up, guess i'll do it.

I'm scared that it will happen again, me freezing up in front of the audience and i feel like i damn potato in front. My social anxiety is insane, welling up as if i was volcano, its really convinient when its an important time then my anxiety would blow up, goddamn.

I feel pressured too, not to mention our grades is actually dependent to each other. One fails to report and everyone would get terrible grades. Its overwhelming responsibility.

I have forgotten how to be responsible. [[Responsibility-Fault Fallacy]] often plays each time in my head. That must be the reason i feel threatened.
The point is, its my responsibility, as a student, as a classmate, as a friend. It is my responsibility to work with this report. I need to do everything i have in my power to finish this report. 

Also here to remind you that:

Our fears are a signal that we need to do something, something important, something that can greatly affect our lives. Like a pain of stubbing a toe, it signals our brain that it is painful and we must avoid it. 

Yet procrastinating isn't something that harms us, but is important to us. Its one of those evolutionary traits we possess that takes us with full disadvantage.
