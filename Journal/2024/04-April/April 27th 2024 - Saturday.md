## Narrative Journal

7:11 AM

I have finally migrated to bullet journaling style. It feels great although definitely needs some improvement yeah.

So, i write some worries in this part.

10:44 AM

So uh, i fucking lost it. This shitty ass phone keeps hindering my progress and mind flow state straight. This shit just fucking makes me want to pull my head in half. My fucking god please please give me new phone. I fucking swear i'm gonna lose my mind on this losing files shit. 

6:38 PM

Recently, i was having random freeze ups in my system. It was absolutely frustrating to be on deep flow state then be just ruined by completely be crashed randomly. I was so pissed but i maybe have ruled it out. (spoiler i didnt)

since it happens only in XFCE4, i decided to switch over to KDE Plasma. While it worked well, i didn't like how hella fucking long it takes to start, like what, 17 seconds? Disgusting. ^97a0aa

I eventually suspected that it was conky's fault, some sort of display info status for all parts of the system like the CPU usage, network etc..

I turned it off, and crashes were gone (least on KDE Plasma). ^3da2b4

I logout to that Desktop Enviroment, only to end up in the wild west of Weston.

I installed Weston because i wanted to use Waydroid under X11. From the name itself Waydroid is for Wayland, and it's stuck there. And i wanted to run my silly android apps. So there thats why.

Little did i know, Weston also offers being a session that i can login to. And there, i got deep lost in Weston

Welcome, to Weston. I loved the most its stacking desktop. Reason i avoided wayland because afaik that time only Sway/Hyprland was the only actual "lightweight window manager. Heck, 300mb usage by default? I could go much lower when I move to Void Linux.

There, I spend my entire afternoon configuring my desktop. It isn't perfect in this state, but its definitely usable
