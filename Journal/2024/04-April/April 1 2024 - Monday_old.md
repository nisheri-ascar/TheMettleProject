People might see me as an strange person due to the fact i act unevenly. Ben and fuck i am just plague with anxiety. 

If i'm in right group i'd become socially active and i won't resort to maladaptive daydreaming. 

I really miss my classmates back in grade 10. i have already opened myself and i have been openly vulnerable with myself to them. Causing me to feel better and actually feel great. 

[Maladaptive daydreaming](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Journal%2F2023%2F08-August%2F(9)%20The%20enemy%20was%20in%20my%20side%20in%20whole%20time) was always be always been my enemy forever.

It's like satan giving me an apple inside my head and that apple is cursed and gives me false happiness.

Internal stimulation sucks. it isn't like material stimulation that at least you can have controlled off by physical means. It's hard especially if you are not aware of what you are thinking or what is the flow of your thoughts. 

Always watching your thoughts is like attaching a debugger on your program. it works well but it's inefficient and takes a lot of mental power so what's the possible solution? I don't know. Figure it out.

I would love to discuss about el filibusterismo. It's really an interesting story written by well known national hero *Jose Rizal*. Discussion are gonna probably happen on thursdays. I want to start researching tomorrow this night or maybe today. 

On another topic this night i am planning to watch "Your Lie In April" with the boys certainly it has become a tradition and i want to keep it that way in future. Its a mix of heartbreaking and happy story that blows my mind.
