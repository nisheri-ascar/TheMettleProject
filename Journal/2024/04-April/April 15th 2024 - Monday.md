I have created so many mistakes from last quarter of last year till today. All of it needs to be corrected, all of it needs to be forgotten and buried.

I still cannot let go of my sudden gloom of my life last year, my life was starting to bloom, i made great friends, i made a great society skills that time. I really thought my life peaked there. In sudden, everything became dark, pitch black. 

I still couldn't let go of those painful memories I had, it was far the worse I had. So worse that I almost ended my life. Many times at that time. I'm aware that mistake I made was my mistake. So i paid what i deserve. Guess we're even now, you know who you are.

I tried to cling to a person that don't even feel the same at all, i wish i never tried, but i did anyways, i was a fool. but it was a lesson, never cling to the past.

Living in past is my mistake. I keep going back but no one is there, at all. Those are just memories that cannot be brought back. People isn't the same from the past, or any memory i have.

I'll bury this paste, everything. Every laugh, every sadnees, everything. Its all obscure memory, its not relevant to the present. 
Why do i keep looking back when i have a promising future? A bright fullfilling future if just i live in present. I don't want to embrace my past, i want to look forward and become the best person i can.

I find myself wondering now, how long have i been in this state? I lost myself for so so long, and here i am, completely aware of everything now. Its like finding an object you've finding for so long, and seeing the fine details of that object reminds you of every moment of it. That's what i'm experiencing currently, i feel so concious, self aware. i feel so awake.

I need to finish my report now, while i don't think it will be good, i will make sure that i have done my best. And i love my work.
