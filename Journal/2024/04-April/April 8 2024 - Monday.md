## Poem Of The day
> I
> In a sea of anger
> I hear many laughter
> And a hint of chatter
> Those make my head shatter
> II
>  Nonsensical whisper i hear
>  Its from my dear
>  Other person is what she cheers
>  I don't think she considered me as her dear

I feel an intense several bursts of anger out from nowhere, it happened many times this day. I don't know where it came from. But i feel like it came from losing someone to love. Anger reigns in my heart.

Sucks, i have anticipated the solar eclipse to happen this night, but it seems that it won't be visible from here.

I'm excited for the next solar eclipse next 18 years :p
I wonder if i'm even able to keep up journaling in that time lol. 18 years will be long long time really.

Not gonna lie it doesnt look bad. while i might be missing out with new features i'd rather stay here than suffer with overheating and constant shutdown. It sucks.
