I feel so scared, i feel so threatened, i feel so out of touch from reality.

I'm gonna commit a crime, forgery.
I lied telling I had a checkup today, when in fact i never ever finished my presentation. I'm fucked, very fucked.

I honestly think i did a pretty well job about it. 

A reminder to myself, don't be ever proud to it. But rather, use this skills to take full advantage. 

Ofcourse, i have moral disagreements. But I have a question, when did anyone became honest? When did anyone became sucessful without lying?
Everything in this world, the ingredient of happiness is lies, whitewashing the truth in order to live with joy.

The true joy isn't on external things, its because its a lie. Its manipulated so bad that we conceive happiness as good, but it always isn't. The world is fucked up.
If i want to survive in this society, i need to do what they do without leaking on my character.

And also, i'm sick at lying to myself. I'm sick acting and fooling myself I'm a good person. I'm a terrible person in all levels. I acknowledge that. Those people who think they're good tend to be the manipulator, false happiness is what they have.

I need to be much honest and verbose to myself, and think twice what i think. I need to learn how to not trust my thoughts and analyzing every thought i have. #review #Mind_hacking
