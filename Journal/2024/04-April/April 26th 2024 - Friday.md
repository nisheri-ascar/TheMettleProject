Alright, so my task today is to make a [[Daily Note Template]] based from [[https://dannb.org/blog/2022/obsidian-daily-note-template/ |here]], which would be useful to finally organize my daily life. I'll be using a [[Bullet Journal]] compress the information i did in a day to just a single paragraph. It should look like this:

I will still write in classic narrative journal but only if i wanted to. Because hell as you can notice there's alot of blank and unfinished entries. Which sucks but will be solved by bullet journaling.

Alright so. Things that i plan to have in this bullet journal

- Mood, weather
- Todays day summary
- Things im happy with / Gratitude thanking
- Things that i got beef / problems -> solutions
- plans
- Expected to do tommorow

==note to self==: Template is currently pointed to [[Daily Note Template]], which could fuck up things if you plan to make a new note tommorow, make sure to delete it until its stable.
