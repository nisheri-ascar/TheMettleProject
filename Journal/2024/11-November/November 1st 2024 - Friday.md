#  📝 Journal

12:04 AM

It's the time of the dead again. 
Often people would visit their love once's graves. 
But, you're not dead, and neither I am. 
Yet everyday I mourn to our death
Fate was too cruel for murdering us, 
He killed who we both used to know

A monstrous amalgamation survives
A beautiful butterfly resides
```cs
entropy.del((bool.requiredBy<T>::StdImport+HashValue=dGFuZ2luYQo));
kkr.fwd(*p[addr], keyValue=41d8cc288e164c666e6cce73f210dbceae4b3b46, p.exec(time)=>threading.AsyncWaitOnComplete(t.buf);
```
