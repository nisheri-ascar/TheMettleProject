#  📝 <(placeholder)> Journal

8:15 PM

An extreme outburst of anger is what i felt just few moments ago, i damaged two items. And wounded myself.

I feel so tired, i feel so helpless. At that moment i just didnt understand what i felt, i didnt understand what the fuck i was feeling. I know it was anger, but i didnt knew how to control it. It just felt like i was losing it, i was losing it. I just didnt understand why.
