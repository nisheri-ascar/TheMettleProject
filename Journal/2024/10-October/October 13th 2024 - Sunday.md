#  üìù <(placeholder)> Journal

5:25 PM
Time flies so fast. I mostly forgot to write journal, i kept saying to myself "Maybe later" and i never realized its been week/s 

There's alot i want to write, hell too much alot that i forgot what to write in this entry.

I want to tell that the [[Dialectical Behavioral Theraphy]] book helped me, although im still in [[Dialectical Behavioral Theraphy#Mindfulness Practice|Mindfullness]] section, i can already feel some change.

I'm sure i have attempted mindfulness many entries ago but failed due to some external events happening. I'm so weak towards protecting myself unlike in internal events.

if i were being real, i get too tired at some point everyday. Not just a tired tired, but like mental tiredness that not even sleep can recover me. 

I was planning to take absolute disconnect from internet back in saturday, but my cousins were inviting me to play. It was inevetable. I just cant refuse, because yknow, its weekend. 

Man, what a school year. I need to quickly mettle or otherwise, i'll be a loser.

Anyways, i have several todos, check out.. wait, where thw fuck did todo list go?
