I don't really know what to feel when I encounter that certain person. It just feels like straight up obsession rather than a genuine love. Are things suppose to work that way? 

I wonder what she feels, I wonder what she thinks. I'm just so damned that I just feel like I am not myself. 

I want to be with her. But I don't want things to mess up.

Yet here I am. Here I am, doing that. Doing the most horrible thing I could do; avoidance.

Why am I avoiding? I don't know. My body is moving to its own instinct.
