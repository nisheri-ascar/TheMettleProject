Heck yeah it's august RAGGGGGHHH!!

Anyways, class has been pretty awesome no doubt. But unfortunately there's not much teaching happening, in fact we were mostly idle this week. Only serious session happened was ETech (Empowerment Technology) and DISS (Discipline In Social Studies). The rest of the time in class, we played [[Ono! Card game]] and I geniuenly hate it lol

Anyways. Its been several days, my snack wouldn't be complete if I wouldn't cross against shanie. There's just still, this ounce of feeling of regret. But I know for myself, this is the right path I'm taking on. This is the path I'm supposed to walk on, the path towards focusing on my studies.
