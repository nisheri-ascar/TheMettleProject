I feel so tired

Time flies so fast when i'm distracted, yet it just feels it havent even reached minute there. But when i'm focused, a minute feels like a hour.

I want to be in focused state. But i found myself in absolute lose state. 

I'm all of my time is consumed in this math research that's suppose to be done by group. Unforunately my group is only 3 people. One got into accident and one is pretty useless if i'm being real. Well she did many things but i'm doing all the lifting. God.

I don't want to be in this crammed time. I want to choose my own suffering.
Fuck this school really. But i have no choice. Only a week away and i'll be done at some point. I need to keep up.
