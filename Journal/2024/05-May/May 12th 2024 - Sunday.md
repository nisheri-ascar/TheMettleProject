##  üìù Narrative Journal

7:08 PM
While mindlesly scrolling into facebook, a suggested friend list appeared. I scrolled horizontally, and a familliar face showed up.

It was the face of the cute girl who played a keyboard during the *Battle of the band* during [[February 14 2024 - Valentines day]], that day was nice. But back to facebook. 

I imagined Jihanna as some sort of chinita in glasses. Well, she doesn't look that far, she has messy hair and few inches taller than me. She give a hikikomori vibes not gonna lie.

And i can see really why Shanie likes her, no doubt she's an ideal girl for any introvert.

If i were being real, yes it still pains me, yes i still can't let her go on my mind. I feel so shit, but hey. It is what it is, life sucks but we must keep moving on. If she doesn't like me then sure. I'll move on and focus on what matters.
