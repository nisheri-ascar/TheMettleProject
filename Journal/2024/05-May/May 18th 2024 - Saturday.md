##  üìù Narrative Journal
9:24 PM
There's just something that i can't get my head off. I'm once again deliberately avoiding work by using the development of nekolauncher as an excuse. It feels shit, i've been here before. 

And its hard to let go. Why? Because, honestly if i were being real. I think without programming, i am no one. I am an literal empty shell that has no personality. There's no one except my knowledge of programming. I'm obsessed and addicted to the countless nights i've been with programming. It feels so good to write and figuring out the problems of a specific code and getting it to work. It feels good. 

I've been desperate to get into that flow many times. But i only end up failing. I don't want to be in that state again. If i really want to finish nekolauncher for real now then i must focus on the imporant things first, Hobby can wait. Responsibilities isn't.

If i once again fly away from my responsibilities, then i'll find myself again in shit state. I odon;t want to be there.

In summer, i aim to give my entire focus to NekoLauncher. But for now i must put my focus on my responsibilities. Afterall, our focus is an [[Fixing My Attention Span For Good#^c4ff5f |limited resources we have]]
