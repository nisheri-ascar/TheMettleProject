##  📝 Narrative Journal
3:20 AM

My body currently is taking the toll I did last night, it doesn't feel pleasant to wake up tired at all. I might need to go back to sleep

8:55 PM
In this entire day my body was desperate for a resolve to its pain. My head was an absolute mess. I must seriously not do it again.

I need to practice winding down, it would help me fall asleep and have my night in peace
