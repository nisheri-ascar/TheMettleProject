##  📝 Narrative Journal
5:57 PM

Two days has passed since I started doing decluttering my mind and my life, and it feels like its been so long. 

### Fear of Unfamiliarity
I remember my first week in this household, when i come back home in maramag it would feel like its been eternity since i came back. 

We always find comfort in unfamiliar places, our minds want to come back to where its familiar.
That's where I am today. The change of routine and mindset makes me want to come back where I'm familiar and feels more comfortable. I don't want that. I want to step out of my mental and psychological comfort zone. I want to excel at the areas I'm weak at.
