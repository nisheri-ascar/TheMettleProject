##  📝 Narrative Journal
1:48 AM #distress_rant

I feel so intensely overwhelmed at this moment. I find myself overly procrastinating to do important tasks that can change my life. 

Currently, its two days until my moving up ceremony, and I'm overly unsure whether I can even walk through and get my diploma.

I know its a really important thing to complete my lackings but i find myself on bind to do it. My brain keeps resorting to procrastination because it knows for itself that I did something wrong and yet I'm not still moving, meta-thinking about it causes even more distress, and until it becomes a feedback loop of distress (see [[Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck]]) 

I seriously need to do it now, and pass it afternoon. I'm sure ma'am jen will understand my situation.

I'll play this on my mind as an ender dragon, a final boss that I need to beat to complete this game in minecraft, but in hardcore, i only have one chance (see [[Obstacle is the way]])

3:59 AM

I feel what? i feel nothing, i feel like an infinite void stretched inside me
