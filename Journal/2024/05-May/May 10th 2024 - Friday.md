Its pretty insane to me that i actually got into with honor for the first time in my high school. Proves that i'm so shit

If i were being real, I'd say ma'am lanie only streched my grade for pity, which is fine but i'm thankful to it. She's such a considerate person but somewhat strict.

### Zen
I wan't to talk about entering Zen state. I have been in this state long time ago but i lost it when i was expelled, thanks to intense stress and pressure i was forced back to my delusional maladaptive daydreaming coping mechanism.

This time, i want to do it right. I want to document it as much as possible in order incase some intense pressure shit happens again I can reread on how to be in calm and mindful state

#### What is Zen?
A state where a person uses his/her intuition instead of his/her emotions to create decisions. This is useful especially at my age where my brain is actively developing. Its hard to make not bad decisions.
