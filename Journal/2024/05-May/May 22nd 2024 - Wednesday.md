##  📝 Narrative Journal
10:54 PM

Yesterday was just absolutely insane, we managed one of the final bosses in our final grade.

Research Defense, ahh one of those horrific things that students often get scared about. It ain't bad though, its just pressuring and takes lots of efforts, days or even weeks of not sleeping. Its beyond inate sacrificing your physical health and mental health.

The story before almost during defense was just straight up miracle, but since im feeling lazy to write it im jutst going yo summarize it in bullet

- we were anxiously waiting, we're in last 
- it was our time, we went inside
- unfortunate strikes, the 80% of effort we poured into; the presentation wasn't showed because laptop was dead
- we were forced to fallback only speaking
- questions asked, it was fairly rudementary
- final questions were boiled, the panelist (Mrs. Veronica; Math teacher) asks us how can we apply those our research to our personal lives
- we fuckton lied lmao
- in the end, we were sucessful, hell we were even praised for having a patience to survey 10 sections
