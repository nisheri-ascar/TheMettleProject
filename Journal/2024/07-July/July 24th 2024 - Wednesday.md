Oh for fucks god what have I done. What a horrible timing. The hell am I doing.

Yeah so yesterday, out of fucking impulsion again I unblocked shanie. Seeing her being miserable changed my mind. Damn I should've not done it really. She never replied. I just, I just, argghhhhhhhhh man I should've read her message first before blocking her. I never realized she was asking sorry ajsgeiveusheiebdjbd tangina..

Inconsistency is killing me so bad what the actual hell. 

Time to change to new account

4:24 PM

Currently at a hospital today, apparently an aunt of mine collapsed yesterday. Currently were acting as watchers for her.

It was an embarrassment that we went to a wrong hospital, I mean, literally the other hospital is just few meters away, and visible from this hospital

It's strange how hospitals just smells the same. Like, there's just certain mood that *makes a hospital a **hospital*** 

Unlike city hospitals, hospital here is somewhat tight, like the room and hallways are just probably 7 feet above me.

This is the room that my aunt is currently staying on. Definitely there's just some certain mood that this room has. The yellowing white paint due to age gives a vibe. Have horror taken my mind recently?
