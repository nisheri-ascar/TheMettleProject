#  📝 Narrative Journal

7:03 AM
I had a bad sleep today, I must not trust any of thoughts to desire in my head. Later on I need to refix my sleep schedule, and take that alarm seriously 

This morning, when I checked the notifications with my main account, Shanie sent a poke. She's just probably messing with me. It doesn't mean anything at all. 
I'm sure she just misclicked pokes, or whatever. I don't want to think there's a motive behind that action. 

I want to focus and devote myself entirely on studying. I want to ready myself going to Taiwan in future. I'll escape from this place. And start from scratch; a new life I always desired. And once I'll graduate, I'll never return to Philippines again. Maybe.

Accomplished with `debootstrap`, the manual install felt exactly like Arch.. except maybe it was more difficult because it wasn't arch? It was painful, but I'm a Linux user.
