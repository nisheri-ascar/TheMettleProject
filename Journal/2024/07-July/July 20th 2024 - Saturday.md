4:29 AM

I have liberated myself to Shanie.

For many years, months and days I have been deluding myself to her. I woke up in 3am, with a cold hand, and just started being honest. And then, I rambled about stuff, from the beginning, till the end. I have been honest.

I'll write full detail later, going to jog now

7:45 AM

Heck yeah, day 2 of jogging. I aim to improve my physical stamina because goddamn my body has never been weaker than this. 

I plan to come back on weightlifting later on, but today, I just want to focus on cardio exercise.


Okay, back to my first entry on this day.

So exactly 3AM, I chatted Shanie. After 3 fucking weeks of ignoring her, I finally fessed up, that I don't feel the same anymore.

I wrote:
> goodmorning shanie, um, kanang, where do I even begin at this point, it was probably the worse of me to ignore you for no reason. I should've confronted you earlier that I don't feel the same way anymore. 

> I'm really, genuinely sorry, it was out of the blue and too impulsive for me to ignore you. Before pa last school year I have already given thought nga I'll give up on you and just live my own life, pero it I was just an absolute dickhead jud nga I ghosted out of nowhere
> It was certainly my fault, abi nakog doing such thing would be right, pero karon, just this moment pajud nako na realize how much damage I have probably done, and I should've done it in much more civilized manner

>It all boils down tung sauna nga I thought you were with someone already, plus lack of communication made me think maybe, maybe how I approach you was making you uncomfortable, and I admit how I approach you was just absolutely uncomfortable, it was weird no doubt
>So I had in my mind after that, to just ignore you and maybe you'll go away

>7 years.

>7 years of worth of memories with you.

>I feel like those memories are just the reason I strived to be with you

>It doesn't mean anything anymore

>I have given all my thoughts to it, and I thought maybe it won't work at all

>Man what the hell am I saying

>3 am moments

>Yeah I think mao Rana akong na ingon

>yeah I'm really geniuely sorry for what I did

>pero I don't feel the same way anymore

With that block of text, she replied instantaneously

>uh, what are you saying?

>Ok ra oi naka move on Naman sad ko tong grade 6 pako Kay abi nko na Wala ka naka gusto sko mao dyun to Wala na pud ko nag chat Kay abi nko na ga sinamok rako 😅 na shock pud gali ko tong nag kita nasad tas Centro balik hahah like ling time no see

> I have a crush on you since I was grade 4 dude pro na Wala na pagka grade 6 tong nag undang nkog chat

This was the time when we met for the first time once again around in 2021, when my life was an absolute mess. She seeing me at my worse was the time she stopped chatting. Typical women moment.

I replied with:

>well, it lasted long unfortunately lol, more like on-off-on-off kind of situation

She replied:

>Nyeh,I was pretty obvious nga like naka crush ko nimo but oh well whahahah

Me: 
>undang naman unta gihapon ko sauna, pero I was like "maybe I'll give it a try again"

And then out of random she asked this:

>Btw naa Koy ask naa Tay classmate na Beyonce ngalan sa grade 4?

Me:

>don't think so,  ngano?

>kaila ko sa iya thou, classmate mi during sa nlc

This was the time I realized she was after Beyonce *the entire fucking time* when she was in our classroom. My god. Kill me already. 

This got me so pissed that I was asking for genuine sorry only to be just asked whether I know her interest, like, bro what the fuck.

She tried to steer back the conversation:
>Ain't mao Ra also kung pwede friends pata gyapon ta hahah..

Knowing myself and knowing her. it'll have a percussion and worse possible consequence, I replied:
> I think it's better for me to cut connection, iwas relapse pre

And then she replied: 
>Okay lng gyapon if that's more comfortable for you hahah

At most of this conversation I have already ignored her, to the point I never glanced at her recent messages that wrote this:
>Ain't fighting also I'm sorry pud

I haven't read it, but the amount of red flags in the conversation is something I couldn't handle. Without second thinking I wrapped the conversation out:

>I think that's all, thank you for reading ning ramble Nako sa 3am lmao
>wishing you the best

And pretty much thats what happened. It took an hour for that conversation to revolve. 

I must say, it was hard. It was difficult for me. Knowing in my past entries I have been insanely obsessed with Shanie. That obsession was so unhealthy it ruined me. So I had to stop.

Now that she showed signed three weeks ago, I just ignored her at most times possible. I don't want to be in the same situation again where I think of her to the point I couldn't take care of myself. It's obsession. It's addiction.

I have already blocked her both of my main and alt account. 

Forsake of my mental health, social skills and overall quality of my life, I have to let go of the past.
