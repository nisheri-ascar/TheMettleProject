#  📝 Narrative Journal
10:36 AM

I want to die. Maybe. I wanted to start a new life, yet I am here again at my lowest. Its so painful. All I wanted was to stay away from her, so that I can protect her against me, the evil me. I don't want to affect her against things that I fail to control. Even if so, in future I'll leave in this place. I want to die. And start a new life.

- everything will go according to plan if I just stay in path and do the work
- nova launcher?

# everything will be okay as long I do work

I always say to myself when things get hard. But you know? I get down depress because I'm not doing anything, I am not achieving anything. And [[Instant Gratification]] makes that worse.. So, I'll put myself on my prime. Change my ways, and apply what I learned in [[Atomic Habits]]; To create systems that will further change my identity.

And I am proud of this crappy work I made

I'll improve eventually if I keep doing it. This is part of the progress, having a crappy output, and I love it.
