Its so strange to me that I don't feel any form of lust anymore after what happened yesterday, was it the prerequisites to beat porn addiction? To stop chasing for love?

A certain mind bias has been running in my mind again. [[Responsibility-Fault Fallacy]]. I kept thinking again that exams tomorrow is a problem. Both problem and responsibility is different two things with both affecting how you view an obstacle. 

Let's review. Responsibility is the present, therefore you have a change to alter the outcome into a positive one. Problem is rooted with negative past, it is a problem because you chose the wrong choice during the time it was your responsibility OR it was something out of your control. Yeah.

Problem is in the past
Responsibility is in the present.

Choose to be in the presence

A weird thing happened. I was just reviewing algebraic expression this time. Only there was a hint of lust coming out from my brain. And then somehow, I was just straight hyperventilating, having intense difficulty to breath and just anxiety hitting my out of nowhere. Maybe my body finally resisted from the lust, it's just my brain was just confused how to deal with it..
