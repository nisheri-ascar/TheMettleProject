#  üìù Narrative Journal

7:56 AM

Today, me, Gelbert, and Cody are planning to go out. Yet Gelbert isn't even awake yet üò≠. I don't know if this is even going to work out but he'll let's just follow how things would flow

9:25 AM
1. The conflict with taking care of the horse
2. It's not my fault
3. The self-centered idiot
4. Forward

This morning, I was grazing the cow and horses as usual. There's an old man in riding a motor gave me a troubled smile. I was holding the most thinnest cow we had, she was from other side of the river, moved here so she could get fat again. When I got downroad I was greeted with the original owner of Petra, Uncle Antonio. From the start he was verbally aggressive, showing his frustration towards how we take care of our animals. He told me he wants to get Petra back, and so I did. When I got back from fetching Petra, he's in a hut. Aggressively staring as I came down to the hut. 

Its not my fault that Petra was thin and unhealthy, but I know that I'm responsible taking care of Petra, yet I failed to fulfill that responsibility. I know I did my best with the knowledge I have. Who's to blame here is my father.

I'm sure that he took Petra without second thoughts, by second thoughts I meant asking uncle Antonio how to take care of the horse. But none, ever he told me any specific instructions how to take care of the horse. I'm sure he didn't ask. Cow and Horses are vastly different animals, with different needs, he thinks that they are the same in terms of how to take care of them.

During our conversation, uncle Antonio had nothing but aggression in his words. It stabbed my ego. In my mind I thought "But I tried my best.." but no words can't get out my mouth. I listened to his aggression without words. Accepting everything of it. Because it was the truth. I'm unable to take care of the horse. I couldn't fulfill what Petra needed. 

Thinking forwards. I want to take care of Spirit the care she needs. But now she's probably dumbfounded that her mother is gone.

In future, in noon, I'll lift gallons of water towards where I graze the animals. Just what the old man said, I'll see the difference if I let them drink. I pride myself of taking care of animal farm. I'll elevate that. 
 
7:40 PM

Fun day

My friends went to my town Camp 1 since Cody's girlfriend was playing for Volleyball. Sidelined hanging out with the boys, it was fun.
