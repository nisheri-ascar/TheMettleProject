#  📝 Narrative Journal

11:11 AM

Finally enrolled, I am settled in HUMMS. It wasnt even my option in first place but oh well.

It was quite intimidating, thankfully I got connection with some people during the reading. It was fun.

Then I encountered Cody, we suffered through it

I can't still get shanie out of my head.
We got across in the pathway. I never interacted to her eyes. But Cody. being a dickhead, called my name out loud repeatedly, asking me to look at that certain direction where she was walking. I couldn't hold myself but said the most horrible things ever to him. It was just something I'd never imagine saying.  

I don't have any responsibilities in school anymore, thank God. 

Maybe I'll enjoy playing Minecraft with my people these times.
