I'm so cooked. 

My brain has already fried from distracting myself with Facebook too much. Goddamn. 
Yesterday I had to reinstall Facebook since my older cousin needed help. But then, I fallen myself into a trap. 

I feel like I'm running away. No, I am running away, from a responsibility. Or whatever.

I think I haven't written what's my current issue. But its all about Shanie. Gosh how many times have I mentioned Shanie in this journal?

Back last week, she sent a poke through Facebook. I ignored it. Because of what I realized back in April. I was just being a fool aight. But after in Monday, I decided maybe, I should poke her. And I did, we did sent poke several times until Tuesday morning. I was running late, when I encountered her in front of the entrance towards our room. I saw Mikaella her close friend. I think it was her circle of friend that were there. And I saw her. I ignored her. As I and my sister departed, I went straight to my room. And then my sister called apon me saying her room was empty, so I had to take care of her. I walked across the corridor without looking at her. I went upstairs to help my sister. And then I went back downstairs. Acting like I'm doing something important while walking past across them. I told myself *"it's just a coincidence, it means nothing."* 

The next day, it was Wednesday. Me and Cindy were asked to buy a pancake worth of 12 people by our teacher. We were outside, it took awhile. I was reading some digital book. And then suddenly, Shanie was Infront of me. I stared at her, while she wasn't looking at me, I'm unsure whether that was intentional or not. But I walked away once again. 

I don't know really, did I do the right thing ignoring her? I knew the consequences of ignoring her but I'd worry more about the consequences if we become together. I'm just so fucked up to be with her.
