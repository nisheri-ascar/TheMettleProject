Early cold morning, god this will be the first year of my senior high school. This is also the first day of my class. I can't explain how much I'm feeling so overwhelmed, god only knows what will happen next.

Damn bro the first day of school was so damn underwhelming, god only knows how fucking boring it was

This was taken around 10AM, our class started without a teacher due to the fact our teacher was taken away from her responsibilities in other role. Introduce yourself segment was literally skipped and our classroom was just nonchalantly existing.

So there's a way I can still go back to STEM. It's called shifting. The way it works is we need to gain grades of atlease 88 above and we can shift towards STEM in second quarter. The problem is that those who shift will be definitely at disadvantage. We need to chase lacking subjects that we don't have during in our STEM. 

I want to do it. But, why do I feel so scared somehow. It's like. There's just something in me that is against of shifting. I feel like my classmates are fine now, unlike before in first section, they were definitely uncomfortable to be with. 

Ah, my mind is so crappy. I need to be myself. What the hell am I. 

I feel scared of those who know my past. 

3:57 PM

I don't really care about those people anymore. All I need is to graduate. If I really dream of pursuing computer science then it's my goal to shift to STEM. Even if it's going to be egregious. Even if it's going to be shitty.
