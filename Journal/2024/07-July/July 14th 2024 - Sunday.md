If I'm just a fucking nuisance to your living then might as well just take my own life, I mean, you guys never even tried to be a fucking parents or something, all I wanted was an emotional care like what normal parents would do, but fuck both of you! Both of you are just so fucking mentally retarded to the point you don't understand such thing happens. You were the parent I never needed nor I asked. You forcibly took me out from the custodity of my aunt, you NEVER HAD ANY RIGHTS TO CONTROL MY OWN LIFE, I AM NOT YOUR SLAVE NOR AN OBJECT THAT YOU CAN DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WISH TO. I NEVER ASKED FOR BOTH OF YOU TO TAKE ME OUT, AND YET YOU FUCKING ABUSE NOT JUST VERBALLY BUT PHYSICALLY, I HAD FUCKING ENOUGH OF THIS ENTIRE CLOWNSHOW FAMILY THATS BUILT ON LIES AND MANIPULATION, YOU ARE FUCKING BEYOND EVIL THAT WHAT GRANDMOTHER SAID, I HAD ENOUGH, I HAD ENOUGH I HAD ENOUGH OF THIS SHIT

Is this what it feels like to have an undergraduate and delinquent parents? I feel like I never belong here because all people are dumb here. They will never understand what I feel. They will never understand me. 

Im so mentally disturbed, yet they never understood that.

I wonder what they will feel if I kill myself.

Will they feel regret? I don't feel any sense of regret when I left home. Maybe if I kill myself that fucker will bury me to backyard just what he always say.

There's still a blood leftover in my nose.

What I had in my mind was the consequences, I was scared of the consequences. If ever there was a car crash then surely I'll be the one who'll be blamed to. 

I really wished I got hit by a car.

Just now, that fucker asked me for borrowing money. My god kabaga sa ilang mga yawa nga nawong.
