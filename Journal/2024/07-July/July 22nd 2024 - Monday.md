man, what a shitstorm. I just realized STEM has requirements needing atlease 85 above grade for math. Grade 10 was just an absolute shitshow. It sucks

I feel like a weight was swallowed into my stomach. It feels awful so bad. I hate it.

But honestly, it was my fault too, my negligence of my responsibilities in Grade 10. But who to blame? There was certainly external forces that caused with this intense shitstorm in my life. Man. 

I need to shift to HUMMS, or maybe ABM. Or TVL, I don't know. 

The sky is so beautiful.
