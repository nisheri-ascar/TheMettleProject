I'll never fit to this society with this kind of family. 
During my mental breakdown, my mother mocked me for "attempting to fix" my problem. My god should I even call her my mother at this point? This family has done nothing helped my grow, but instead putting me down. They're so shit, I hate them. 

And yet, I live in the same household with the people I hate ever since. They're so emotionally apathetic. 

I should kill myself. I don't really care at this point, the damage is too much to me. This family has ruined me beyond any means. They aren't my family, they will never ever be my family.

Honestly if you think about it, I'm just a mistake, both of those fuckers fucked just for their own pleasure, never I was a plan in first place. But just a mistake. A horrible mistake. 

That mistake can't last long in this world.

Mistakes can cause punishment, I wished instead of punishment I get a heart to heart talk and continue living, instead of planting fear and violence.

They mostly notice my mistakes rather than the correct things I do. I wish atlease I gain a praise. It isn't childish to desire a praise, but it's a way to gratitude the person and keep their motivation running.

I feel like I'm running out of motivation to take care of Spirit.
