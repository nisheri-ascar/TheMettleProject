#  📝 <(placeholder)> Journal

 5:23 AM

There's a thought gnawing in back of my mind. But I don't want to tell it. I have immersed myself too much in this. There's no way I can stop. I have nothing to gain nor to lose. Maybe yes, maybe not. But if ever this fails. I just want to remind you; myself, that you can't blame yourself. Everything has gone so complex, so mad you just don't know what to do. You just chose what felt right. Still, it was your responsibility. If ever things go wrong, just remember to learn from it. 

You are doing great, you earn money now, you can socialize, you can achieve more.
