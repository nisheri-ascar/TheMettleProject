#  üìù Generic Journal

7:38 PM

I have finally printed a physical copy of a self help book.

I haven't binded it, but i will do later on.
I chose this book specifically since it targets my own disorder. **Bipolar Disorder.**

As you have read from my previous entries. You can definitely tell my mood extremely swings to extreme levels. If i get depressed then shit just goes wrong. If i go full manic then shit just goes wrong too. Wherever both goes just goes wrong.

all of these are frighteningly correct, what I so call Maladaptive Daydreaming is a byproduct of bipolar disorder; a constant psychosis to copulate with my issues. No wonder really why i always find myself back to  where i started. Those efforts to stop was equvalent to cutting a weed; You only remove the visible surface, but no matter how much you cut it, it will always grow back. *I NEED TO REMOVE THE ROOTS.*

I need to read and study this book. This might be the book the will finally change my life.

Subtle Art of not giving a f*ck gave me values, but it wasn't enough to beat my mental illness. I'll read it again once i finish this one.

For now, I'm thankful I have these resources around me, the printer, wifi connection and a laptop.
