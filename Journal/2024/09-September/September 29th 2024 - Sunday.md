#  üìù <(placeholder)> Journal

8:55 PM

I want to talk about Marian, a classmate of mine who seem to have interest with me. I know this isn't just my delusion because i have concrete proof.

During when we cleaning time, i was behind her. Out of just my curiosity i just stared at her back. She turned around and stared at me back. She became red and just reacted out of nowhere. Gered, a classmate of mine and her cousin too reacted with "*Oa ra kaayo ka mayang!"* (*you're overeacting mayang!*).

There are occurences too where Gered and her wouldve have strange way of looking at me. Its enough for me to understand there's someting going on.

To be honest, I did have slight interest with her. But during that time I had some things to deal with Via (I haven't wrote what happened. Everything is so fucked up about her.)
So i just shrugged it off, acting like nothing happened.

If i let myself locked my thoughts into her. Then Via incident might happen again. I can't let it happen.

I don't deserve someone like Marian (if i said the vice versa then it'd sound so manipulative, lol..), she's just too fine and stable that she isn't in my same wavelength. Like what i said to Via, we might've suffer if we continue letting ourselves get loose.

Okay, putting that aside, lets talk about Via.

### The Via Incident - Wrong Person in Wrong Time

I mentioned in [[September 1st 2024 - Sunday]] that Shanie rejected me. I fucking cried all night from what happened. It was painful, it was horrid, it was something i'd never imagine happening. I geniuenly loved Shanie with all of my heart. But maybe me rushing things out was the root of that event.

Something I didn't mention, that during [[August 30th 2024 - Friday|Buwan ng wika]] i was actually planning to crossdress. Yeah, with native dress, wig, and makeup, i was all ready for it. I was all-in high manic state at that time. Unfortunately when my teacher disallowed me, manic was replaced with lowest depression. I almost couldn't move, it just felt like everything  around me was against it. But thankfully, thankfully. A friend who i cant remember his name (renz?) lended me his extra barong. And holy shit he was a life saviour. It explains really why my outfit feels so half assed in the pic on the journal entry. Manic went so high that i thought it would be funny if i held my classmates arm because i was pn barong and she was on filipinia(?), which was Kayesha. In the pic you can see how tight her hand gripped apon me. Because they thought i was gay, which i am. maybe, im still on the stage where im having an identity crisis. It was also their way of living my spirits up after being denied for crossdressing. 

In my mind at that time, i was equivalent to a woman. Not an exact but almost a level of it. It was the first time i never really cared of what others thought about me, it was the first time i really felt that i wasn't alone. It was the first time i felt that kind confidence, i really never imagined it.

And this is where Via comes in, she knows my struggle unable to crossdress. So when i changed my cloths, and went outside she voluntary held my arms. And we went back to the venue, i think it was in waiting shed beside flag pole, we ate choclates that Chloe gave me. Never would've thought that Shanie, yes Shanie, was behind us. They weren't too far, but only realized she was there ***with phia, yes phia*** after we went back to our area. My GOD, MY FUCKING GOD. SHE WAS THERE.

I thought she wasn't going to attend or something. I never imagined it.
