#  📝 <(placeholder)> Journal
5:12 AM

I want to say my previous attempts to change was wrong, mostly. Thankfully it's just mild, not extreme. Being clingy to other girls was my major mistake. And just labeling myself "gay" was just wrong.

Anyways, time to revert some changes I guess. I got this change so wrong. 

I'll holding girls, maybe an exception if i crossdress or something.

Man, sure that my mind is so unorganized, i maybe havent even written about my crossdressing stuff, about via, about how i turned into this abomination. I'll write this later on
