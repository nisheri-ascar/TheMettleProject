#  📝 Reflective Journal

**2:19 PM**

If I were to summarize what was my August like in one sentence, its where I went to many places that I wasn't suppose to be in hopes to find something better, only to be back where I started.

Well, alot certainly happened in August. I haven't wrote my entries digitally here. Things would make sense if you read those.
 ...
Shanie last night rejected me. Yep, you read that right. She rejected my ass off, finally. My ass was so desperate to be with her. I was courting her aight.
