#  📝 Reflective Journal

5:08 AM

Its been awhile since i wrote here. Alot of things has happened. I started a business, i started to earn some money, and lastly. I'm finally dating one that i loved the most.

I maybe haven't mentioned her somewhere in this journal. But Via is a type of girl who's simple, and that simplicity just caughts my eye really.

If I were being real, there's some negatives about her. But I can't say I'm different myself. In fact, I'm much worser than her. 
But, for once. I'm finally trying to love someone geniuenely, to love someone that isn't Shanie, or any girl between my spectrum. Hopefully our love flourish healthily. To have love that both of us can be happy.

Later on, I'll discuss some serious topics regarding to our relationship with her. In order to establish a mindful and open communication relationship. 

Being in home of toxicity really gets my mind off-guard, but I'm steadily progressing. I'm doing the right thing.
