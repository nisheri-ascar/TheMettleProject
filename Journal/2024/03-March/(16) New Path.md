I've been taking things the wrong way, if my past self would look at my progress, he'd say its terrible too i'm sure.

1. Never trust anyone
2. Embracing solitude
3. Repeated selfness

## Never trust anyone

I will never, ever trust anyone again, even Gelbert, even Shanie, even anyone else. I need to build a secure barrier to protect myself. To protect my entire identity, to protect my fragile heart. 

Shanie never loved me, she sees me just a friend, those glance and smiles are fake and phony. Its just to fullfill my feelings. Its a selfish dynamic really

Gelbert hated me in first place, i probably made more damage after i transferred to BNSHI, i'm too unworthy to be here. 

My personality is plagued with disgusting traits, terrible traits that i got from this shitty household and my entire life. I'm horrible in all means. 

One solution beats this problems all

## Embracing Solitude

This situation i am today isnt different from my Grade 9 days. What worked well from those times is embracing loneliness, practicing gratitude with all loneliness i have. 

I should probably stay away from the circles of friend i made. It was forced and i stick like a sore thumb. Stay away. Kill yourself. I need to kill the idea of my existence.

## Repeated Selfness

Identity is literally Repeated Selfness from greek word.

If i want to change my identity then its easy, just make a routine, be consistent with it and few while it becomes your personality; an identity.
