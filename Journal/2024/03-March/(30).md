A hot water is just molecules being "excited", quite literally. All molecule move and jump, and bump to each other. Causing for us to perceive it as hot and painful because those molecules are bumping on our skin.

That's the same thing happens on my mind right now, its too chaotic. Full of ideas that bump to each other, causing me to loss control of my own reality and become psychotic. 

The *fire* sources from anything exciting or something gratifying. My mind is the *hot water*. 
A gasoline is anything that stimulates me (e.g social media, caffeine etc.)
