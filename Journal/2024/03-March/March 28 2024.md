Guess i'm back being gay lmao.

Yesterday, this was our performance task for MAPEH. Our concept was a drag queen show, while others was about patriotism and family themes, we were literally "outside of the box". And that uniqueness brought us to our sucess. Thanks to jasper i guess. 

I enjoyed the time while i was crossdressing, i desired something like this for a long time. 

I really thought i can't pull it out, i got scared and fucked by my anxiety and psychosis. But thank god people was supporting me. I couldn't help but be thankful to people, specially Chloe! (The one who's beside me, the tall ass girl) she seriously took my makeup simple but enough to make me look feminine (but still have traces of masculinity lol), shouldve had covered my big ass arm muscles, if probably it was covered then i'd look feminine enough.
