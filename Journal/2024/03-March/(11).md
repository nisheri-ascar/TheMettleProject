The emotional stress i brought with me from this morning till this night, i made a severe embarrassment and probably anger. The feeling of angst is so intense it eats me. 

This morning, i was ready to present my speech, when something just felt wrong. My entire mouth shattered to pieces. I stuttered, my brain shut off and it was fucking embarrassing. I wish i died that morning. I would never ever wish to do such thing again.

But to be genuine, it was entirely my fault why that happened. I wrote the essay with my bare mental health on deadline, and sleepness nights. I wish i have died really.

Through my fault, to my fault, to my grevious fault. It was my fault. It was my responsibility to handle my time better.
