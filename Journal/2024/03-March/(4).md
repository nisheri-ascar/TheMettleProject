It made me realize how much cheating is really an option in this school. The amount of deadlines, these are much deadly compared to back when i was San Andres. I could intensely feel the academic pressure. I have no choice but to cheat really.

Yes, even myself it feels immoral to do it. Its beyond feels wrong. But forsake of survival. I must do it.
Otherwise, my life will eventually get worse and worser. And no doubt it will send me down to deepest hell again.
