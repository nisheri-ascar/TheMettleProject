Once in a cresent moon again, i have decided to fix my life for my entirety. This time i have a reason and willpower to actually move. Shanie, the only person that my world revolves to. She's everything to me, and i will do anything whatever it takes.

Whatever it takes, i need to change my life. In order to love her i need to love my self first. I have lost the sense of selfness all this time. And i, for once yet again feel much existed and my sense of self has come back. 

She will be mine, i will make her mine.

Today is her birthday, but it sucks since i never ever greeted her. She did come across our room but i couldnt go near her thanks to my anxiety. I want to give her something that's made with my sweat and tears, something that i made effort to. I want to give everything of me to her.

Yes, i'm obsessed with her. Not the right word, but in loved. I'm madly inloved. And its cringe i know, but this needs to happen to complete my adolescence period. 
I will become a dickhead, in a good way, i will try many things that myself would probably fear, and have the courage to be rejected. 

This period of my life is important, it will build my personality in adulthood. I want to be ~~someone~~ not someone. But to be a better version of myself that has courage and willing to do anything. It starts here.

Here marks the another arc of my life, the uncomfort zone arc.

I somehow managed to make something that resembles flowers finally.
