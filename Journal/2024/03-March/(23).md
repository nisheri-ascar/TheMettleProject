1. mind hacking
2. proving everyone wrong

At last, i have finally used the things i have learned from [[Mind Hacking - How to change your mind in 21 days]]. The first thing ever i managed to reprogrammed is during my psychosis session ( #todo ) i'd make myself aware that i'm in psychosis and possibly i'd never come back to reality ever again, if i manage to break out then i'd use "[[Boredom is good for you, actually]]" skills then return to my original good state, then finish my tasks. Once i repeat it enough i will become better.

I have a habit to not finish a book, so please, #reminder to self, finish [[Mind Hacking - How to change your mind in 21 days]] 

If i really wanted to prove everybody wrong, then it starts here, it starts with myself, it starts with proving to myself i have worth and i can do anything.

Now i shall study for my exams on monday.
