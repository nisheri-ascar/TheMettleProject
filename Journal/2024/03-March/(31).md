Last day of march, tommorow will be April

4:46 PM

I find myself constantly struging and fighting against myself

**Where did i go wrong:** overstimulation via social media and porn; neglecting self-control procedures

**Solution:** Turn off wifi, be alone with thoughts

The problem is, i was already lonely longtime ago in mychildhood. I have developedthis coping mechansm to avoid boredom from isolation.
