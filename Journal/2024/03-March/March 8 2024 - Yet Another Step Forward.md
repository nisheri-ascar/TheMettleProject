Yesterday I have done another insane step again. Its an huge leap that gave me alot of lessons, and a step outwards my comfort zone.

pic here

as of from my last entry, i made some paper flowers. It was painful at first but it became a pleasant experience that my body has already memorized the pattern of folding a paper into a flower. The painful part was that all sides must be exactly the same, otherwise you'd have a really bad time. 

It also somehow made me realize two things

* I have an artistic view
* hard things are fun if you love the process 

Artistic view was something else, maybe i already has artistic view long time ago, i just don't know or how to utilize it. I don't know how to turn my imagination into a reality. And that's what i did.

here it is, the final output. I'm so proud of it and words isn't enough how much i'm soooo thankful to those people who helped me. Sharmaine, Nerhyz, Reychelle, Althea, Hazel, Kristy, and many more than i can't write here. I'm so thankful. Maybe if they didn't were in my side this Paper Bouquet. Its insane.

## Hard things are fun if you love the process.

This is by far the most obvious that i should've had done for awhile. But the experience was still different. Despite having sleepless nights, i loved the process, every folding had meaning, every minute, every second. It had meaning. The amount of focus / deep work state i had despite sleepless was something i wanted to be in again. 

Back in the storyline, last few minutes before i gave her the flowers, my anxiety was becoming ballooned, classmates were cheering on me and while others were cheering on me. Reychelle who was her classmate (albeit they didnt knew each other thanks to odd classroom arrangement) went first to their CSS classroom. She told me to follow later on. Few minutes left and i waited for Neryhz and Sharmaine to come. And she came, and we finally went on. But, there was a plot twist.

My initial plan was to surprise her during their CSS class, though for really unfortunate reason, that backfired. I crossed with her in the main exit lobby, it felt terrible for a second. All of my ideas shrinked down to just an accident.

But, Mikaella saves the day yet again. My god she's such a good person for doing things. After some fooling she to Shanie they rushed outside, then Mikaella came back and paved signal to come. I went to the back of lobby gate, and after seconds of calming myself, i went outside, went closer, and called her. And i said "Belated Happy Birthday". 

Her reaction was priceless, something i already imagined expression happening in front of me. She must have been really never expected it. It was fun, it was great. 
While still flabbergasted from what happened. We went to the canteen. On our way, it was great to see my classmates and acquaintances see me with her, they already heard my story and now watching me being with her. Niethan who's my friend in electrical major was giving me a huge smirk. I replied with a thumbs up to acknowledge his reaction. And inside the canteen i also came across with Bezamae and Althea, the amount of look to my eyes telling me "Congratulations!" was so heavy and overwhelming.

After in canteen, i asked her whether i could stay in their classroom, their teacher really don't care who the hell enters their classroom so I did.

I talked with her classmates, yada yada stuff like that. And they decided to take picture

Here it is, us together in CSS classroom, it was really something else.

I wonder what she does with the pictures.. Not that it doesn't really matter at this point.

I'm happy, thats what matters.
