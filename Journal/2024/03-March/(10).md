I remember being unable to work even on simple tasks back then, even washing plates was already a hell to me.

I find myself in same state, tommorow is our deadline yet here i am barely started anything. 

The main reason i'm im this state is **fear**. The fear of being hated, the fear of rejection, the fear of something horribly goes wrong when i sacrifice my sleep. Thus i run into a coping mechanism (such a listening to music/masterbeasting), and eventually it becomes an loop and time passes and i still have done nothing, off running to my coping mechanism again!

I want to make something clear to myself, *there is nothing wrong being rejected*, its part of the process. *who the fuck cares if they hate you?* they have a solid reason to hate you. If you want to change then change that negative traits of yours to be better. ^55c8c8
