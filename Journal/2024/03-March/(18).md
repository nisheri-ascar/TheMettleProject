10:20 PM

This day was somehow long again.

This afternoon, i decided to visit my grandmother's grave, it was her birthday yesterday. But i only got to visit her this afternoon.

The fare to ride tricycles is insane, 20 pesos just to reach the cementery. But from cementery to school is just 15 pesos, what a price really.

There, i manage to cry the fuck out of everything i was holding for so long. I managed to say sorry i shouldve told 4 years ago. I'm still carrying that grudge and regret till this day.

Also, this night i managed to invite my friend rafael (will put pics here later on) to my aunts aniversary with her husband, it was a fun small bonding we had for a while. It was worth it.
