Exams are finally done, this day was weird. 

During our CSS exams, I found myself sitting beside shanie, I tried not to noticed her for no particular reason. But after she finished her exams she gave me a random headpat. It was absolute wtf moment for me. But yeah, I'm thankful that happened I guess. 

Well, exams are over, this quarter is over. Back to square zero now, I'm certain that my grade is possibly lower than expected since I haven't passed most performance tasks. I was still adjusting, but I think I'm 100% ready for 3rd quarter. I think I already figured out how to keep things afloat, to pass performance tasks as early as possible. To write lots of notes, yeah. But I'll savor this long ass weekend today.
