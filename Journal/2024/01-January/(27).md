This one is uncomfortable to talk with.

I am a form of multiple blobs of multiple beliefs, clusterfucked into one blob. An irrational, unstable, misformed, a patchwork. I have no unique sense of self. I don't know how such monstrosity even existed. 

I am no one, I merely imitate a personality fit for who I am facing with. In order to conceal my hideous clusterfuck personality. I am, nobody. I have nothing unique on me. 

As if I'm in a stage play, with no people watching. Only myself I watch just to please myself. I am comfortable in that. 

I have no idea what to do now. 

I'm depressed again.

I'll just keep moving, giving up and commiting suicide will be the worst sabotage to myself. I have come this far, if I survive being in toxic classroom then how about a toxic household? I just need to endure it while being good to others and become strict to myself. I need to have faith while taking action.
