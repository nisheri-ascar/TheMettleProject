I don't understand. Where the hell did I go wrong this time. What the fuck. I'm in deepest hell of depression again. I feel like I'm about to dissipate at this point. I feel so fucked. I feel no hope. My god. 

5:07 PM

I understand now. I tried to reject my mistake. It was my mistake, everything of this shit is my mistake. I let an anger of some online douchebag eat my emotions, and I let it go wild. Thus the perfect starter for disaster. It never felt good. I never wanted to start a fight at all really. But that asshole really got into my nerves. 

My greatest lesson yet again, don't let your anger eat you. 

Now that happened. I think I have not unwrapped yet what actually happened. Well, here's all of that.

It started on that Saturday night when my father went home, fucking drunk as usual. I told him how stressed I was after the pig escaped on cage many times. And I was still on influence of anger. He just went being pissed on me instead. So, my vision went dark and all I saw was I was punching him. I can't even process what I was doing. I never had intent to do that thing, it was horrendous, it was out of character of me to do that. And thus they hid me on Manoy's bedroom.

I never saw Manoy's bedroom inside ever once. It felt so horrible to be in an unfamiliar place while being in stress. I could hear my father throwing my things off in my bedroom, and his words that was hurtful than a knife. I felt stabbed many times. The amount of verbal abuse was immeasurable. 

I slept in Manoy's bedroom. There my phone was dead. I never had any chance to run away at that time, my thoughts was just filled with nothing but processing what just happened. I couldn't understand, did I just do that?

I slept, then I woke up in middle of the night, I saw Manoy literally sleeping with difficulties in the floor, man really had to hang his feet on his chair just to not touch the cold floor. And there I was sleeping in his bed. Words can't really say how much I was thankful to him. 

And yesterday morning, I woke up with guilt. And I couldn't still process what the hell still happened. After regaining enough consciousness my mother went to the room I'm in and told me to escape and run towards other house. 

I did what she did, and there I had a breakfast. Uncle Joseph who was the cause of me kicking the pig after it escaped was just, I don't know, his face pisses me off. Aunt Ai² who was living there gave me some motivation; a will to live. My phone was still dead that time but thankfully there was a spare charger there. I checked and I saw several messages from aunt. I thought she already forgetten me that last night. But I had no doubt and went away.

And there, I was finally in Maramag. She was waiting for me. I cried, and I ran away from reality from that day...

Here's what my hands look like at this state. 

I ran away, yeah. We watched Spy×Family on that day, we had much fun. I thought my new life starts there. It wasn't unfortunately. It was just a distraction. A way to cool myself off. 
I can understand why my aunt encouraged me to go back, she don't want any mess going around. She had enough of my father. And now, its my responsibility to face him. Its no ones fault but me, I'm the only one who can solve it. 

So, this morning, I woke up. Went home back and, I was still eaten from my anxiety. After seeing him, he gave me a punch, it was understandable. But my past self can't still get it why. 

I have the answers now, I need to endure him, whatever he says, whatever he do, I need to endure it. I've been enduring it for so long but I feel like I'm wearing out. But just few years away and I will keep enduring him. I will keep enduring him till I graduate, and finally I can escape. 

I just need to accept things, I just go "Fuck it" and continue living. Eventually I will reach my goal. That's all.
