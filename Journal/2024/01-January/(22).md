I finally locked this phone's CPU frequency down to lowest possible. Its borderline unusuable but forsake of the battery's longevity i must lock it. Another downside is the kernel dies once phone gets improperly shutdown. So i need to be careful.

I finally had my first exam here in bnshi, and guess what? It sucks, really sucks. The paper has uncountable mistakes and wrong sentences. And a paragraph of text in the goddamned choices? Are you retarded? 

That being said, it sucks as hell. But enduring it is the only thing I need to do.
