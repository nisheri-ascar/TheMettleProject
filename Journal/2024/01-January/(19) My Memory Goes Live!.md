yep, its finally online, roughly 3 storage now is my memory. I don't have to worry about it, ever again. 

Its kinda insane really, its been 6 months since i started journaling, and it vastly change my life. Maybe if i didn't [Synced my journal](September%2010%202023.md#^b200eb) off to this laptop then hell i'd be depress again. I'm sure my future self will thank me for doing this. Hell yeah.


Now, January 22nd and 23rd will be our exams, i need to focus today doing and relearning the things i learned. Its a great chance i have today since the most smartasses in our classroom isnt present. I could exile and squeeze the greatest out from me

so while scroling down in yay packages, i found out that [lazymc](https://github.com/timvisee/lazymc/tree/master) exist, its just a server starter or stopper, its could essentially become an alternative of mcsleepingserver starter which what i was using before, albeit i never really liked it, thanks to the fact its javascript, pretty bloated..

#todo might want to do it if i figured the gcloud server is unbricked now.

also maybe helpful to future, current lazymc has issues with 1.20.4 minecraft version, workaround patch exists here https://github.com/timvisee/lazymc/issues/57
