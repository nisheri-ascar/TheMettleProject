**NEVER DRINK CAFFEINE EVER**
I am feeling out of control of my head when I drink caffeine, please don't drink caffeine ever again, the mental state is fucked as hell.

I think yeah, I can definitely agree because this has already happened to me. Many times, facing my fear was something else. It felt joyful after it. The time when I finished my clearance, the time when I finally faced my fault, the time that I leaded a group. It felt so good. 

I want to face my fears.

Dream already reacted and told shit. And do I look like I give a fuck? No LMAO, Christ this bitch asshole needs to go outside instead of defending somone online, he has weird intersocial relationship with dream, oh my god he thinks he's uniquelike holy shit do something that can contribute in this society instead of arguing online. I want to punhmvh him virtually but I'm staying calm, he already took the L, but if shit escalates then I'm going to drop the most horrendous words he'll ever see in his life.
