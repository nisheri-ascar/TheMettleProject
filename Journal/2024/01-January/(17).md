I must say, I find myself quite in conflict. 1/35 in ESP subject is unacceptable as hell. The topic on ESP is far I'm really interested to, how the topic is morality is inline with my interest. Its a disgrace really. 
But its my fault anyways, my schedule got too much in conflict thanks to my past actions, yesterday I was suppose to study ESP but I was consumed on doing my portfolio for CSS and did some little bit lazer things distractions. And now I'm with conflict with the memorization of "Babang Luksa" which we will present tommorow. 

I really need to learn to do things early and time/task management, that way I won't be in this sort of conflict again. 

I notice too this school mostly focuses on taking notes. Unlike back in San Andres we're already given with "Modules" that we can take note on. Here they do either discussing it then sending it on a Group Chat. I still need to figure out whether they have GC for each subject. I missed a lot of notes back in the time I wasn't on AP GC, it sucks really. But well, all I need is to allocate a pie of my time to write notes. Since they focus too much on what is written, apparently notes are added in performance grades. Yeah..

Practicing solitude is probably the best thing I did. I find myself having full control of my life. No one dictating how or what should I act. But it comes with great responsibility too. Full control of my life means anything could really happen at this point. Its up to my present self whether to choose what is good, and what is not. Well, there's no absolute "right" in this society, often we choose what is wrong, then we realize that is wrong so we move it to less wrong. As long it works for me and it doesn't cause any ruccus in future, its fine. But that less wrong will become wrong at some point. That's why I need to keep adapting towards my environment. Great example is I was an active student back in Grade 10 in SAAMI, though I think solitude will work in this classroom since their social circle is fueled by toxicity, which isn't a case back in SAAMI. 

All I need is to be consistent of being loving being alone, and leveraging my time being alone to do great things. Faith without action is dead.

Tomorrow will be our presentation, I'm really hesitant really whether we can pull it off tommorow. Messed schedules up schedules, but I'll have faith as its theonly thing I can do, with action of course.

I had an awful psychotic breakdown yet again.

During our practices, I was beyond the time expected to go at district office, which is where my mother works and father gets us. I was entirely nervous all that time, over thinking all possible situations that could happen. I could've ask him to let me stay longer in school but I'm 200% certain that he won't allow me. Worse case he would definitely cause difficult situation..

I had to lie.

In order to avoid any conflict, its good that I must whitewash in order to avoid conflict, all I need to do really is to memorize babang luksa for real now.  ^4cbda8

I noticed during my psychotic breakdown too, its hardwired to me already to do maladaptive daydreaming when hard situation happens. Its a coping mechanism that I can't avoid. I need to figure it out somehow.
