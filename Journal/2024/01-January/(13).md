l am reminded subconsciously that he isn't my father, but an enemy. He's an enemy that I need to defeat not by physical harming, but proving him wrong. 

I almost got too drowned in distraction again, I must keep reminding myself to defeat him with success. 

Reoriented my mind from my path, I have gained a determination.

I almost manipulated an information again. Lying that Phia has a scent of my ID. Using that false information to gain conversation. I don't want to do it ever again. Disgusting. But well I got my ID so.
