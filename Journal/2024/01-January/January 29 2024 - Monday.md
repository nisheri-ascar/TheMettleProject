I'm in good state today. During these good state usually I forget to journal cause in my mind I see "what's the point?" But no that's wrong.

I need to document out the good things that makes my mind in decent state. So that if I fall in depressed state again I can quickly reference these good state times and get back on track quickly as possible. 

So, my current project is porting play it then writing an article about it

So you're probably confused now what the hell i'm doing, i had no enough time to write this. So, here it is.

[Last year](https://github.com/nisheri-ascar/termux-packages/pull/4) i attempted to port and compile playit natively for termux, i had zero idea what the fuck rust compiling does. And i pretty much gave up that time.
This week however, its a long weekend vacation, and no schoolworks as the quarter already ended(I should write the weirdness of teachers in public school too #todo). I took and seize the oppurtunity to finish this project. And hell its done. 

Well, as the photo above, when it finally compiled, I was happy as hell as its the first time once again i felt being true programmer, seeing all the build finish and the program working, dopamine flooding ensues in a good way. I really think this is much a healthier activity rather than masturbating or deluding in daydream. 

But wait, someone commented on my work?

At first honestly, i somehow feel threatened, a generic way i view in criticisms. 
But thankfully i figured it out its my social anxiety playing, i told myself "This is a criticism to improve my work, not to threaten." And continued to reply in respectful, understanding manner. I get that the contribution guidelines does not fit the package i'm porting to. So thankfully TUR (termux-user-repository) exists. And i already made my [PR here](https://github.com/termux-user-repository/tur/pull/798)

This day is my stepping stone towards improving how i view criticisms and doing work, as well openly communicating with people i work with. So i guess i'll call this a celebration for myself!

Next up, my plan is to write an article/guide on "How to make a minecraft server out of your old phone!" or something. it'll include reworking the jekyll website stuff. But lets face that tommorow, and classes will be back at wednesday. So i don't think i can't continue, but its worth having something started.
