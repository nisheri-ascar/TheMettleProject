I had the most horrible psychotic breakdown. It gnawed into my mind leaving this house and live in forest. Its a terrible thing to do i know. I will always have things that i'll have left, i'm a coward if i run away. I don't want to be a coward, i will face everything.

I need to write a mental troubleshooting manual incase this type of situations happens again. It feels beyond horrible and the mental toll built from one thought to another thought kills me
