8:36 AM

What a horrible messy sleep again, I don't know where shit went wrong but I'm having the most horrible sleep again. I need to figure out later how I can optimize my sleep so I won't walk up tired again. Its tiring.

Besides that, I realized one thing that I should do. 

## Yesterday I didn't, Today I will do it.

> To become a better person than yesterday is my goal
>  -- Me
