i might be cringe self cocksucking, but i feel like i'm proud to myself. Think it like a parent being proud to his own son (Which will never happen irl thats why i'm doing it to myself ;P )

alright, some insane change of plans. Instead of writing an article. How about we create a video about making a minecraft server out from an old phone? Its yet another challenge but i'm willing to tackle it to learn new stuff. I must keep myself aware that i'm doing it forsake to learn, not the end goal.
