I have this habit to remember small memory from the past, then somehow making into something that feels pleasant to remember.

It was a rainy afternoon in aunts house, the sun has almost set. I don't know how but its just really pleasant to remember. The sound of the rain, the droplets of every water. It feels so good somehow.

This is nostalgia.

Every time, whatever time, I take myself back on those days. The day that really has a special place on my heart was April 7th, 3 days after my grandmother's death. And the anime *"Your Name"* was showing. That anime was beyond my essence of reality that time. It just felt like that anime filled the void in my heart, it was really unbelievably good that even remembering it or rewatching it just gives me goosebumps.

I remember the time on that easter Sunday too. It felt nostalgic, the night before the easter Sunday where we prepared for tommorow. Painting eggs, the warm lightings, the cold air outside. Man it was just some great times. 

There are numerous memories of nostalgia. I want to write them all here. Maybe if there's a moment that nostalgia hits I will write it here.

I have forgotten my determination and goals again. I must reorient my mental framework to focus on working; substituting distraction with absolute focus. I want to be addicted from the focus.
