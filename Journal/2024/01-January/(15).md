I find the plot of my life really strange. 

Back sometime, somewhere. I woke up in late rainy afternoon, feeling I had to shit, I immediately ran into the bathroom. Afterwards that, the rain hasn't stopped, in fact it stayed the same. I haven't talked or found anyone since I woke up, so I went to the living room. There, I found my grandmother and my mother talking casually, I don't know what they're talking about but I went there anyways. I just stayed beside my grandmother, it was just the normal that I stay beside despite my mother beside me. 
There's still something that you don't know. 
My grandmother raised me, my parents were young as hell when I was given birth, roughly my mother was 18 that time. So yeah, teenage pregnancy. 
My grandmother had an immeasurable hatred towards my parents, and I think they don't know what my grandmother says to me. 

Today that I live with my parents, I find myself always contradicting to them, one thing I do and it will be always wrong. Maybe I was really raised to be contradictory to them. Its a strange situation indeed. Raised with words against my parents, and now I'm living in contradictory with my parents.

I always heard words like "Your parents are the worse" or "They never cared about you". In my system it has already set as a hardwire. It will always be the correct to me.
