First day being in home in peace finally. 
I had an awful sleep, woke up somewhere in middle of the night. I had a delusion again of Shanie when she gave me headpat, you're the worse really.

Anyways, I'm planning to hop back learning Japanese. There's a new novel of Rascal Does Not Dream series, I'll try getting a Japanese version of it and then start my way into it.

And also, every night I'll memorize the multiplication table, and once I memorized it I'll do the division table, and maybe the square root table(?)

My fucking god, finally, I made my own outlet extension, it was anxious as hell as there's a chance that everything in our house burns, but I'm glad it works.

Now, I took the chance to get back my headset, I'm gonna reward myself as much as I can today.
