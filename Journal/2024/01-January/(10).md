7:54 AM

Fighting against my thoughts is rough as hell. I had an awful sleep and woke up in middle of the night just to jack off, and I'll be honest, it isn't worth it really. I'm sure its because I didn't do any wind down yesterday plus I stayed up late. 

**reminder to self:** sleep is important, wind down for like 30 minutes. Preferably at 7:30 start turning off devices. When sleeping say to yourself *don't think*. Yeah..

Now I need to face some responsibilities. Memorizing babang luksa.
