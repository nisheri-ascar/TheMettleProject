## Banana Tree broken

I woke up horribly late from what I'm supposed to wake up, thanks last night of memorization worthing nothing, it was a horrible sleep.

Thus, after I cleaned my bed, went to backyard farm, I was horrified what I saw, banana tree got down. 
Thank god the roots was removed too, which means it can be planted back. It would end my life if the tree got destroyed. So I had a plan in mind. To dig and replant it later. I went with that route. Ensuring I'd find my grim reaper costume in last minute. But, I never got into that case really. I got too unlucky the box that was above this plasticware storage (or whatever the hell this thing is) held its breath for last time, its underneath torned itself down and all items that was in it has fallen down. Such an unfortunate event.. Anyways. I still had an another costume, which is pretty generic: a hoodie with a cap and a eyeshades. Yes, my role is a sole murderer, it quite fit on the state of my face today, I look like shit fr.

## Unready from babang luksa

I was, really really unready, I even went as far as giving a [lie](Journal/2024/01-January/(17)#^4cbda8). That lie never ever helped me. Fuck you past self I hate you. It horrendified me, but thankfully we had a little time to practice. But I still sucked at memorizing that part. And then, the time came.

## We.. Somehow pulled it off.

It somehow worked, but legitimately my actions really fucking sucks, llike its just straight up obvious that I never memorized crap, my god. But hey, it worked out decent I guess..

## Direct Demerit from Teacher. Acknowledging the truth
