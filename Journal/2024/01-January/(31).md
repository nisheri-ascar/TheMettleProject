I still have my head yesterday about arguing with a person in reddit, disagreeing and discrediting lazer after having its PP release. Ofcourse as someone who followed closely on its development it pisses me off. But i need to keep my heads up and don't want do drain an energy from some obvious troll.

Anyways, i have some thoughts about returning in a social community again.. I feel like the loneliness has gotten me so far. 

I mean, i left for a reason. But now i'm returning?

I feel like there's some tradeoffs when i leave and join.

I leave and there's loneliness craving me, but it helps me think in clarity

I join and i feel peace, a sense of humanity and my social anxiety goes away.

I want to write comprehensively about this topic but i don't have much time. Later on #todo
