##  📝 Narrative Journal
8:54 PM

Fourth day since I got this phone and I think I slowly adjusted myself now, compared to previous days where I'd bomb myself with much information that overwhelms my mind.

Those days of overwhelmed by underwhelming will be over. I must keep my mind and look back on the days before I got this phone. Its a powerful tool, and I have a responsibility to use it.


The structure of my journal is extremely overwhelming too especially it was designed to keep up with the pace of ASAP (of course this was a bullet journal). While I thought "Hmm, maybe I should stop using this template" I made an effort to make this template, there's no way I'm not gonna utilize this.

I'm slowly picking up from where I left off in the past making this journal. Hopefully hopefully, I can bring myself to former glory.

Today, I'll be continuing to reading [[EasyPeasyMethod - Easy Way to quit porn]]. I already told myself that if my mind is messy and my judgement is clouded, then I'm sure it's caused by masturbating and porn.
