Gotta be the most happiest day of my life again ![[received_269524889509929.mp4]]

Its currently valentines day, this early morning i still had some mental issues and worried about things. I was anxious, and then suddenly a jolt of impulse to buy chocolate. And so i did. Without any further thinking i ran towards their classroom. For a moment i felt an intense sadness, but i saw her friend Mikaella outside. And their i asked her, and she seem to understood the assignment and told me to hide. There i waited and suprised her. Then, that happened.

It was wild, and it was my first time giving chocolates, despite my cowardness i managed to give it to her. A core memory indeed.

Things still pisses out in this shitty hellhole house. But, one thkng i need to remember. I must not emotionally depend on her. Its unhealthy. Its terrible. I need to endure this shit household and figure it out to live.
