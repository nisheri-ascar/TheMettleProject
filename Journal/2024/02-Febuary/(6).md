Man, fuck this guy really.

> Wala nay respeto ang mga bata sa ako tungod nimo

Hell how can one even develop respect to you, you don't even know how to respect others. As always "don't do what you don't want others do to you"

> Unsa may tono nimo ganina sa ako?

How do you reply to someone who has an angry tone? Ofcourse in return you'd reply with angry tone too in form of self defense. 

I don't really know really. This guy is just a straight up narcissist at this point. He values himself so high and he refuses to take any of his wrongdoings. I fucking swear. 

Instead of fixing any of the mess and accept he's at the fault. He just straight up never even deny, and instead blame it to other people. How emotionally immature really. 

I don't imply that i am emotionally mature at my stage currently. I acknowledge that at some point yes i am immature. But as soon i recognize the problem, i try to fix it as much as possible.

I am so pissed right now. But here's the context on what happened.
