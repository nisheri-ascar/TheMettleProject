It took awhile for me to process, but here I am fully optimal and concious. This week was a ride for real. Especially [[February 14 2024 - Valentines day]] and [[Journal/2024/02-Febuary/(15)]] it was just straight up nuts that I managed to get my shit straight and had a time with her. Crazy stuff.

For context, Shanie is.. Wait have i already mentioned our story? Maybe not lemme check just a sec.

Ok nope, alright. Here's a little backstory

(empty seat beside shanie was my seat)
I was Grade 4 when i was her classmate, those time were simpler. I couldn't imagine this moment. How? I don't know. Back then she looks immature as hell and i was legitimately different back then.

Now oh my hell of God she's the peak of beauty. Her beauty is beyond my comprehension.

I have, a long term goal now. **TO GAIN WEIGHT** 

I have heard many people wanting me to gain weight. If that makes me maybe handsome i need to do it. 

This is cringy as fuck but for sake to match her beauty i need to balance myself out too, i need to take care of my self seriously.
