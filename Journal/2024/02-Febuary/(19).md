I don't know, but i feel like depressed again lmao.

It feels like the world is at it again. 
Why can't I have a normal life? When going home i just feel like i'm spending this portion of my life being isolated. I feel envy seeing all of my friends able to go and hang with them. 

My mental health becomes worser, maybe i'll become a strange adult in future for having an empty adolescene
