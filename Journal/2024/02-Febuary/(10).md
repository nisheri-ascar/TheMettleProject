Suddenly, I have a strong interest riding a horse. This morning I saw my father's friend finally riding a horse. I always thought "why the hell is he isnt riding a horse" when he's tying rope (tugway?). Legit he looked so dope when he was riding. And this late afternoon i saw an elderly man riding a horse. What discouraged me to take horse riding seriously was the tools needed (e.g saddle). But that elderly man literally rode that horse with just a sack.
