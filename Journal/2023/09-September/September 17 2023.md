There's a rough connection between me not sleeping and becoming depressed. If ever I dont sleep then my day becomes ruined, that is true and I can prove it many times. I need a decent sleep, I need it.

Sorry if I didn't wrote to you, must feel a little bit lonely huh? I can't assure I won't do this again but I'll try my best to avoid it. I don't want you to feel lonely but there's just times sometimes I feel don't like to write

### Isolating myself wasn't that answer, nor was staying in social media is the answer
This was something I realized in long run during staying on social media and isolating myself. If I ever isolate myself I just end up being depressed and find other way to escape instead of doing actual work.
