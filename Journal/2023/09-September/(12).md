Today I will focus to things that really matter, schoolworks, my family, my friend's, and hobbies I want. 
I've done nothing but complain, giving a fuck to small things that doesn't matter. If I could just ignore things they say to me and things that my head is making up. But that's a pathetic excuse to avoid giving a fuck.

I will be never truly be happy if I embrace happiness directly, I must suffer before I can obtain it.
