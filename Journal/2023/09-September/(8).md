Gotta confess, I hate being left out. I don't want losing people seeing me as the center of attention. That's just who I am, I'm hungry for attention. 
But ofcourse, things happen, not always the spotlight is mine. I don't want to be a narcissist yet again. I just want to ignore it and focus on important things. Yeah I'll try focusing important things. 

In #Music I need to evaluate my knowledge, in order to learn which and whatnot things I know and I dont know.

No way, I am becoming selfish again?
Everytime i go through with my self-improvement road I seem to only talk about myself to others. This isn't right..
This is probably the effect of being the delusionative procrastination ( #todo #writing ) I will write extensively about it later on. But the solution is **to distract myself myself productively** this way not just I avoid delusions that can cause procrastination but also get things done.

Few things that happened today. 

Visited Hans' place today, absolute banger despite having short time.

(I look like gay here wtf)

Anyways, second thing. Carmela permanently closed our DM in discord, good thing I guess I'll never be in part of her life again, which she wont be in mine too.
It was always what I wanted in the beginning, I need to seize every moment.

Thirdly, finally had something for a melody for our music performance task:

I don't know if this is the direction  I really want. But I can just change it in future.
And thank God I have a circle of friends where they do music production. God save my life
