Alot happened today, electricity died from 6AM to 6PM. I have another funny anecdote that happened this morning.

9:32 PM

I got a lil bit sidetracked but let's begin from early morning, where I goddamn just woke up and saw my classmates talking about them jogging and going to school, my dumbass panicked and hurried down to the point I forgot to toothbrush.
It was worth it, I spend my time outside of school. Another memory that will be carved in my head ![[received_1151221942949297.jpeg]]

Anyways, It ended half an hour later, walked with Adriel, Hans, Fritz, Herny and Johannah.

Sure it was really fun, it was something that I will never forget.

Fast forward to after going to my aunt's house, went in and realized she left me alone bruh, had to cook for myself, and cleaned the house in hopes she'd come back soon, but nope. 

It was somewhere 9AM after I got home, unfortunately the time I get back there was no electricity, so pretty much I did nothing and slept, and woke up in 12pm where they apparently made *handa* (I forgot English I'm stupid) for Virgin Mary's birthday, ofcourse th cousin would come, since there was no electricity we stayed in my cousins place till 4pm, usually it would just take somewhere 2 hours but it was extended today, absolute blast. It kinda made me realize how it's more fun to hang out w cousins when no electricity, no wifi, no shit.

And afterwards, that's all happened.
