Here I am again, in deepest hell of [[Kristofer's Hell]]. This is hard. 
Alot of good things happened to me. Thanks to those my delusions was fed, and here I am. 
I hate it when many good things happen to me all at once. This happens.

> It all returns to nothing
> I just keep it letting me down letting me down
 
***Come sweet death*** is probably my favorite song when I'm depressed, it's about depression but it reminds me what's the reason I keep striving, to avoid what the song has said. To not lose everyone you love, to not lose everything you truly care. I need a companion.

I think I've been consumed with mind trap again.

Finally! Thanks to SyncThing i managed to sync crap of my notes without any problem!
It'll be much easier for me to write stuff, i love you SyncThing!! ^b200eb

I learned something new yet again. **Deep work**. Basically a state of mind where you can work efficiently and fast.

I don't have much time for now, but i'll write later on!!

Deactivated Account or not, there's no difference really.
My brain sends false positive when i deactivate my account, Giving a false comfort of *actually* doing something, but in reality **i didnt do anything**. There's just no difference even if i deactivated my account.
#### So, what to do??

Its a hard decision but i think i need to keep my account open. Its a good thing im aware that social media is poisonous, i can remind myself that ***this discomfort was caused by my conscience against from what i am doing***. Sounds easy in theory, because it is.. maybe. 

### Modern Problem Requires Modern Solution!

Thanks to [this video](to be filled) it made me realize a thing, i always keep thinking that deactivating account would make me productive, but nope. Its entirely the different thing. 

>But what about your addiction!!? Think about it!!!! -- My past self probably

Yes i know i know past self, but our approach was wrong that time, we were *avoiding addicition* instead of ***fighting it***. Thats why many times we often relapse back to addicition! Thats the answer to the thing you and i suffering.**We need to fight against it!!** We can probably learn much when we fight it instead of avoiding it.
Unlike drugs where its completely stigmatized, social media isn't. Its everywhere, it has become the part of society. We can't avoid it. 
So instead of going against it, i am going to try my best to moderate myself. There's no point going against it, we already know that..

### Few things and tools i could use at my disposal

1. Digital Wellbeing's **Focus Mode** 
	Fortunately its built in with the phone i have, it helps me block the apps that distract me. Though downside is it lets the user turn it off anytime, but i'm not that kind of person who would be tempted by it, i know my limits.
2. Pomotodo
	I actually misused this one, it works but my dumbass made it a todo list for non priority tasks, it got me overwhelmed and died.


i think thats all i can write. Oh and a reminder from past self ![[Journal/2023/08-August/(27).md#^0fcc95]]

I learned how to link a block of text!!!!
