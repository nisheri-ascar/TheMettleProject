Its saturday, i dont know what to write really. maybe i should backread last entries i made. ah, ofcourse, im thankful i had these memories in grade 10, its a plesant memory that will be carved in my mind. even if its short lived, its a lesson i can lean anytime.

i'll backread and quote most of my journal entries. and comment with my progress.

#### from August 9:

![[(9) The enemy was in my side in whole time#^d74ab6]]

this idea is what kept me alive, despite from the hardest point i remind myself *"this is just a test"* although slowly i have forgotten about it... i want to help people. i want to change the world.

![[(9) The enemy was in my side in whole time#^9dfd56]]

this is still true in some cases, though i realized something, its that if i keep myself busy then the chances i stick with maladaptive daydreaming is low enough, and i could focus properly in my tasks. this was the time during the filipino roleplay, it felt good that i achieved properly leading a group.

what the hell ive been doing really? i dont know. i dont know.

Even if i'm not part of the school anymore, i will do my best to become the best of the best student, i will do most of my task and, everything will be fine afterwards, i have faith. but ofcourse faith without action is dead, i know that for too long, i just need to keep myself reminded about that.

Its really insane how much ive gone so far, really far. I cant believe i wrote journal for two months and counting. Backreading my entire journal has given me a view of how much i truly changed. Its just quite comical to think why im skipping writting when i can write memories that i cant view and experience again, this experience is unique to me and i want to write about it. Well ofcourse the suffering is different, every suffering i am going through and today, it isnt really unique to me, it doesnt really matter nor its not worth to overthink, i shouldnt think that *"i should be depressed as if i was carrying the world"*(something i learned from [[Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck]]) however the good memories, theyre are and will be always unique to me. i should value them as if they were gold. well yeah time is much expensive than gold, its too expensive that its irreplacable.

This current situation i am currently is just a test. Its just another entry for my journal, it will be just another lesson i can learn into. 
I have no regrets, im already done regretting. i know truly that Carmela has already forgiven me. Not his brother though, and her parent/s after just knowing the situation. I understand their side, and if i were in their shoes i would be mad too for sure. I need to explain things. It will be fine, everything will be fine afterwards.

I'm planning to do a fresh start in my life after things happen, if i ever be tranfered in BNSHI i will delete all my social media (except for main) and stay anonymous till they caught me. ^9c9b94

Honestly im ready for whatever life throws me, whether if my expulsion gets cancelled, whether i get transfered to bnshi, whether i wont get my moral conduct, i am ready, and i will be always ready for whatever life will throw at me. 

Good night.
