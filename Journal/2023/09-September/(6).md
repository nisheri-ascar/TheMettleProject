Yeah, maybe I just let my anxiety eat me. I have faith in her.
To be honest, why am I doing this? To get revenge of Chen? Isn't that bad thing to do?
I don't know, I don't think she seeks revenge for them either way.

What would she think if I was just using her to satisfy my own desire? Is that selfish?
She don't deserve someone like me. But I've got this too far. I need to finish what I started.
I promised her help, and here I am.

I will do my best to help her.

Our performance task is creating music!! I'll make this #p0 cuz I really want to make something great!!
In my head I want to create a city pop, maybe just make it related to love cuz it is what it is lol.

But ofcourse, it comes with a price, I need to sacrifice my time doing programming stuff. I need to shift my entire focus on making the song.
I already have the keen advantage!! I have circle of friends who can make music, a phone and laptop!! All I need is an initiative and a will to learn doing it!!

At the same time I will use noting, I think I already honed my noting skills that much, so I'll try it today.

I will do my best!!

All I need is an action. Faith without action is dead.

Gah!! I got lost again from my thoughts >.>

Hundred of information running throughout my brain, my delusions feeds my impulse, causing me to procrastinate and just feed my delusions more.

Wait, that's quite a breakthrough! #breakthrough

I finally pinpointed why I procrastinate, it's that reason. 
**Solution:** Stop consuming any media and do work directly.

I need to learn how to prioritize next, I kinda suck off on it. But now I need to study for math for long quiz tommorow

AAAAAAAAAAAAA MAN, I am doing the right thing yet why I feel so anxious ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°
What if I got things wrong, what if the problem was already solved?
One thing I can tell though, ma'am jasylnne isn't comfortable about it. The way they flirt out of nowhere. She working against her own will.
Its not like I want act like hero, but rather I just feel extreme pitty from her. Things could escalate at this point, if they go far to the boundary then that's it, it'll most likely things will go downhill. St. Lawrence will have.

#Epic
Insane, two things happened today.
I already discussed my concern about ma'am jasylnne to sir... And I was right on the money, I assumed. Apparently it was just wrong schedules caused for them to to mention it. It's a funny anecdote that will never be forgotten again ![[Screenshot_20230906-221411.png]]
Thank God, things was just a misunderstanding. I was geniuenely concerned about ma'am jasylnne's mental health. *she's working against her will* I had in my head. 
Thank God it was just a misunderstanding.

Secondly, Carmela. Out of blue she chatted me on discord ![[Screenshot_20230906-225542.png]]
At first she just asked whether I wanted to join SSG (wait, I haven't even finished talking about it yet..) 
I knew this was coming, not just the time I expected. 
Well, I guess I'll start anew with her. But I've already set some boundaries between our relationship, to make things run as it should. 

It's insane, two surprising things happened to me. This was something rare only happen to me. 
Before I was secluded with anxiety, now I regained my confidence again. I can do it, I can survive, I can strive and do things I truly want, and I truly care about. 
This is a turning point of my life. 
I can be better.
