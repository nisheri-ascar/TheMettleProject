I need to keep my head's up no matter what.
I'll stop blabbing about myself.
Blabbing about myself is just the straight reason why people feed me attention and affection. I need to cut that.

Hell yeah!!
I managed to get back!! It's just pain in the ass to get back due to the schedule change. Now  I have ways to have exercise

1. I'll wake up in 4 AM, right after I wake up I will clean my bed and go right away
2. If I fail to do so, I will try to do my job quickly in afternoon
That way I don't have an excuse to do exercise anymore.
Honestly it wasn't because I didn't have an motivation to do so. It was just rough to start, it was just my brain playing tricks (mentioned in [[How to be disciplined]]). After this it shouldn't be that rough to start anymore.
And yeah just some lil bit realization but it's kinda related to how addiction starts, #todo #p2 !!

I don't know. But one thing for sure is I did something that will drastically change my entire life.
