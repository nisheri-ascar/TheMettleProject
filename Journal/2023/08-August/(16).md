I actually forgot to mention yesterday that I talked with this girl, her name is Joanna something I forgot. In 9th grade she rarely talk with me, but during spacing out in my classroom she just went in my chair and talked. I was surprised on what she said.

Apparently she suffered too from last year's school. I thought I was the one who was targetted by Chen, but it was much worser. She was betrayed, manipulated and lied with. 
Chen must be the worse person we've ever met. We agreed that 9th grade shifted our views on how school was. We thought school was scary, we thought all student was like that in this year. But thankfully not, in this school year, no one is a leader. Everyone works with their own Accord. And it's nice to see, unlike in grade 9, it still sends shivers down my spine. 
People like Chen, there's not much we can do about it. We can just simply ignore them and avoid. Cause one you hit them you're pretty much gone bye bye at some point. 

But Joanna, she seeks self improvement and academic achievement. She was just like me, finding ways to be a better person.
I want to help her. I want to help her making the better version of herself.
I will not fall in love with her cause I have KAngel-sama in my side. Cheating means death to her.
