It's fucking insane, my teacher acts like as if I was just his friend, its bit comfortable and uncomfortable to think

Just a few minutes too I was called by my sister, I was called since their laptop had low volume, she said "My brother is a tech guy he knows what to do!!" I love being treated as an IT person :DDDD
Life has been going great!! I fucking love my life!! Though I know things will go downhill at some point. So I'll be ready anytime
And oh yea I forgor to write too, just had a lunch with my old classmates, at first I was a bit uncomfortable (given we have a history) but everything felt so natural, my anxiety was gone.

5:10PM

This day was an absolute blast.

9:39 PM

I'll be honest, my head isn't screwed right. My impulse has driven me off to insanity cliff. Why am I expecting multiple girls to like me? There's still part of me that cannot reject the idea of having multiple girls, stop it it's dumb you fucking retard. 
I have this daydream where I reject girls, bro like hell someone will confess to you at some point, you're literally retarded and has screws incorrect, better off focus on school. **REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SCHOOL TO LEARN AND GRADUATE, NOT TO GET A FUCKING GIRLFRIEND**. Having relationship is a waste of time, sure it makes you happy but in the long run it'll get worse. 

Anyways, I hope shit calms down. I will let myself calm down.
I might try to write the plot I have in my head since.
