Haaauuuwwww finally exams are done, I can finally rest in peace, thank God I finished it 🙏🙏🙏🙏

Looking forward, I need to create a priority queue for my workflow framework. I'll do it later but for quick reference, it should look like this

> - [ ]  Make stuff #p0

#p0 is where I immediately need to do a task
#p1 is where I need to do it in a week, stuff like memorization and performance task, exams.
#p2 is where I will do it in a month, typically hobbies and things that aren't much important but would be nice if it's done

![[Instant Gratification]]

This was what I realized after spending long time with my classmates. Although they have everything and just always play Mobile Legends and stuff, I'm pretty sure they're misrable inside.
I'm not saying games is bad, but just pursuing it to the point it becomes a part of your life and destroys your everyday living, it can make you miserable.

I will stop masturbating now, I will practice clinging into the nothingness. ****Odin sacrificed himself, he hanged himself in a tree while being stabbed in straight 9 days, then becomes a God.*** so why shouldn't I took sacrifice myself? I will sacrifice myself for my future self. For him, for him to have a better life than what I have today.

I almost forgot!! Taking notes is super important!! Tommorow I must start writing notes to whatever I want to learn and write it on my old notebook so I can efficiently learn how to take note properly in school too!!

Tommorow will be September, gosh how time flies so fast!!
