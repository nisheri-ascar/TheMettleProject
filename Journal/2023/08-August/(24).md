I barely had sleep last night, I'm in awful state at this moment. Just make me suffer other things not this ongod

Somethings definitely *not right*, maybe because something in me thats guilty because I haven't done anything and the fact i got barely sleep. I've been overthink that crap. Well not today!! Hopefully I dont collapse during the day...
Even if so, I wish things will be okay, there's just an anxiety eating me inside lol, it feels like somethings gonna go wrong, but in reality anything can go wrong whether you and I like it or not, it's just how things work.
