I find it really hard to make my dreams vivid, when I was a kid it was so vivid but now I barely can see it. I remember reading an article where the certain supplement I was taking had certain vitamins that causes my dreams to be visible. 

Shifting to other topic for now, I feel like my anxiety and other negative feeling has came back yet again, maybe this is because I haven't had a good sleep yet again.
I have a tendency to wake up just to.. you know, doing *the thing*. It was just dumb but it was already programmed in my head to wake up in middle of the night just to do that. But even so I didn't proceed to do it because I was tired and went back to sleep. I heard that just waking up even just a minute during your sleep already ruins your sleep cycle. Guess I'll need to find a way not waking up during sleep hours, cause I really feel like shit today
