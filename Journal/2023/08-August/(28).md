I maybe don't understand myself. Who I am really? What I am? 
If I wanted to be disciplined then I must know myself. Who I am?
Who I am?
I need to start meditation again
To be honest, I really don't know myself. Probably. If there's a secret I have then.. *certain someone* doesnt exist. 
Maybe that's the reason why I couldn't let go of my old self. 
*She* was the product of my obsession. Maybe I could consider myself a narcissist. *She* plays an obsession game with me. 
I couldn't tell everyone. I'm too scared. What if their views shift to me?
I want to forget, I want to delete *her* out of my memory.
I want *her* to never exist at all. 
*She* never existed in first place.
*She's* just inside my head
Who is *she?*
*She* is me
*She* never existed
*She*

This is a problem.

If I ever confess, then I will become a void. Pretty much.
She's the cover of my void

It's scary.
