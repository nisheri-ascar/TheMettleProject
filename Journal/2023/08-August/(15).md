Classes are back yet again, and I have a lot to write here.

But before that, I just want to tell myself that **delaying is bad.** Since pretty much I've been delaying things, and that's the most awful thing I'll ever do that I do in repeat. One day if I keep delaying one thing (e.g writing journal) I will regret it once I get older. I don't want that to happen.

So yesterday, our classes started, althought no real lessons are up yet, it's pretty much events happening. Real classes will happen next week I think. 
Let me tell you a story, I was a literal embarrassment. I literally called our teacher "Bai" which means bro. 
I have a video of whole thing happening, but in short context I was finding an outlet to charge, and ifound this guy and asked if if there's an outlet near him. It was our teacher, words cannot tell how embarrassment I caused.

Oh here's the video, watch the whole thing so you' understand what's happening.

Anyways, jump to my real feeling. Carmela was my classmate this time. I asked myself, *Is my self improvement phase just a show to Carmela?* I mean, to be honest, yeah, that was my goal in first place, but I realized I can apply it more to improve and have benefits to myself. I want to change, I don't want to run again, I want to face everything I go through. 
I always remind myself that **school is just a place where you learn and test what you learn, what happens in your school social life is irrelevant.** 

I will focus what I want to do and what I can do, not my emotions and distractions

It was a blast yet again, this class felt wayyyy for chill compared to last year. I feel like everything is what it's suppose to be what it is. There's no one above, there's no one below. Everyone cooperates as one head, as a team, as a community. It actually warmed my heart to see that type of classroom again. It was perfect everyone was in perfect unison.
