Goodmorning 

10:56 PM

I had a long chit chat with Joanna (or whatever the spelling of her name). It's insane how much she trust me. She opens up to me more open than anyone else. I don't want to break her trust, I don't want to fall in love. I want to help her, she's a friend. She will be the friend that will be the realest to me
