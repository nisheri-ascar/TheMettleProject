I had a realization.
Opposing to yourself isn't self discipline, you'll just end up hating yourself more
Like raising a child, you must understand them, you must embrace what they feel, that how loves works. To accept, to guide, to be better.
But if you raise your child with violence, they don't open up to you, emotionally, physically, everything. They will end up hating you more.
That's just similar to having discipline to oneself, to embrace, to understand, to guide. 

I will think myself as a two separate entities. One is me in absolute calm state named  **"Heiwa"**, and the actual me. Let's name that entity **"Konton"** (Japanese for chaos)

I think this is practice and mentioned somewhere, batman effect? I dunno.
I will always think that **Konton is my default state**. 

Konton fits it's name in this context. Konton means *chaos* in japanese. I had my fair share of having a bipolar disorder. 

Every single moment, I am in Konton. Actual peace isn't present, it's just chaos, mixed emotions to be correct. 

To reach Heiwa I must calm myself down, remove any distractions, and probably mediate.
Use my logical intuition to make decisions.
Yes, this is just [[Don't make decisions during you're in emotional state]]. But I decided to widen and clear some grey lines. 

I am aware that this idea is written somewhere, but fuck you and let me adjust the ideology to fit with myself.


Konton is the child me, an energetic, unpredictable and just a chaos by itself.

Heiwa is the educated me, full of ideologies, in utter peace, wise and a good decision maker.
