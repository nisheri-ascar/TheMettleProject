Too early! But I decided I'll write a journal, I'll write whatever goes into my mind and write it!!

So today, it crossed into my mind what if Zerotier Routing VPN was actually the cause of the issue of playit program being slow as hell?
Previously I tried it and it was legit the slowest that pings doesn't even work, will try it!!

Huh, that could be one reason why it performed shit when I played Minecraft in my laptop
