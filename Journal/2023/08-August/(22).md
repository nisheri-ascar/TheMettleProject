Actual classes has started, it feels great actually. Well hopefully I keep that feeling till the last day of school.
I will try my best to be the best and becoming competent I would be. 

I have something to blow off, and I super hate it so much. There's a girl named Samantha. And to be blunt I don't fucking know whether she either likes me or not, I know it sounds dumb but hear me out
She always sends out some strange mixed signals, I dont know and it just messes with my senses. I'm a type of person who reads every single fucking details small to everywhere, it's just who I am. I guess I'll just ignore shit and **just go fuck this she doesn't like it if she do then I don't fucking care I'll focus on my studies** man can't just girls go kill themselves they're hard to deal with smh
