I have yet the best sleep again, I didn't wake up much, just straight sleep. It was somewhere a video I watched, the trick is to tell yourself "I'm a deep sleeper" and visualizing yourself sleeping. it works like a charm. 
And also, finally my other phone has a charger now. It can charge 24/7 at this point. Very cool.

I have a realization. I often do and want things from my impulse.
