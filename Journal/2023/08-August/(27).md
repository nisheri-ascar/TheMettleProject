**6:21 AM**

I'm in really terrible state. I need to deactivate my accounts and delete other apps that distracts me

**7:36 AM**

Here's the plan, I deactivate my accounts, then I will jump straight to what I need to do. But I need to test something

No doubt I work by impulse, it's a bad thing but it'll take time to remove it from my programming. 
So, instead I'll exploit it.
I noticed that what contents I consume influences what I do. And that's what I'm gonna do. For what I'll try or tasked to do I will watch a video about it for 10 minutes or two. If it works then cool! If not then I'm definitely dead. ^0fcc95

***EXAMS AT AUGUST 30!!!***

**10:31 AM**

Went to nearest forest to check our animals there, after seeing the view, I felt resolved. Sucks I don't have the pic but maybe next time!!
I had a self-reflection for good 30 minutes while I was there. It made sense to me now, everything made sense to me now.
I lack honesty, discipline and consistency. Thanks to social media and other distractions I lost in track again. It's pretty sad. Always has been there's just unresolved and stress kind of feeling inside me. 
I forgot what to write. Great.
It's always this feeling where I forget something really really important. It's my greatest weakness. Well this is the point of journal and taking notes
