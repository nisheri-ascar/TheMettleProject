my writing went downhill again. I have once again being consumed by the sea of anxiety and depression. I am super overwhelmed. I feel like my head is spinning.

Thank God I am aware again this is just an illusion my brain has given me.

A letter to nobody.

Dear nobody.

I am in prison again.
I only have myself. And this room.
I have been in this jail many times. 
I always had the chance to break free, yet I find myself here again.
I was not here because I disobeyed a law, nor I have sinned. 
Its because I chose so.

The reason I feel miserable is because I believe I am miserable and nothing can change it, when in reality I have an ability to do so.
 
I need to change how I think, I need to  how I do things. I need to change my beliefs, I need take action.
