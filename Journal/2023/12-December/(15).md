i was able to face off my two microanxiety for this day

1. Doing intermission
2. Giving gift to my old (girl-ish)friend

Doing intermission is something i did without a sweat, i did it without any hitches. My panic attacks were worsening but i somehow controlled it. Here's a stupid face i have with it

Giving a gift was an entire different story on the other hand, i somehow have picked my old fling which was Angel Hope, that was back on Grade 4, but i'm too lazy to write now what was our story back then. I can't believe she still didn't want to talk to me after that. But hey, my values and beliefs is fucked and thats just the nature of girls are.

## The real deal

I really wanted to talk about the real core problem of me, i finally figured it out all along.

> Maladaptive Daydreaming -> Desire to make that delusion true -> Manipulation -> Creation of problem

that has been the routine of my own thinking system, it has beyond ruined me. The situation I am currently makes that evenly true. Nerhyz and friends has been already avoiding me, i am beyond fucked. I have destroyed their trust on me, i have ruined our friendship. 

Today, i want to fix that fucked value on me, i want to change my identity. I need to create a solid plan and repetition.  

Currently i have 19 days till return of classes which sounds not enough, but its too much enough.

The triggers are these (i think):
1. Problematic situation(s)
