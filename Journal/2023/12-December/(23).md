I want to start this entry of journal of apology, I have been way way too distracted to write. I feel shameful and I am, I feel horrible. In many ways i have tried to avoid writing. In reality I wanted to write, but my impulse to run off and avoid pain is unpleasant. I am avoiding the false feelings of unpleasantness of an action that clearly benefits me yet it brings much more unpleasantness, thus forming an hell of loop.

I abandoning counting the days, its 3 days before christmas. Yet I feel so empty. I can't feel anything at all

## Prisoner of my own thoughts.

I am a prisoner of my own thoughts, I am.
