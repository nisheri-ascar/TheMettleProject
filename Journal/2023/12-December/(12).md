My bitchass phone died literally, but this day was memorable as hell.

we had a christmas exchange gifts for our circle of friends. I never expected to happen really. I feel like this was a highschool experience i've been yearning for so long.

I got Bezamae (the one whos holding the hello kitty plushie) and gave her my stolen gift to her, i'm so proud of it<3

it took quite alot of effort for me to do it. In last minute yesterday i had to wash it in its horrible state


a little bit sidetracking but,

it feels so strange to be still welcomed on the room, i'm unsure whether i could actually enter on the school, afterall i was expelled on that school, doesn't that mean i'm technically trespassing? I really wanted to go but, things could be probably be messy as hell. I don't know whether i should come or not. 


anyways, back to where i was. I stole the plushie, washed the hell out of it. And it wasnt so bad.

Yeah, it was really really in bad state before it was washed, years of dirt built up. Thankfully with my **masterful** washing skills all of the dirt was worn out.

Now my future problem would be about if theyre wondering where that plushie went. hopefully it gets burried down to forgetness of void.

with this goofy ahh webcam pic, here's what i got from Nerhyz, apparently she was the one holding my name. I don't know whether it was suppose to be her sign of, *you know* since she has this bracelet too, or just straight up a friendship bracelet. Who knows really, but i'm thankful and grateful such friend like her exist. And these group of friends who gave me solace in this deepest pit of depression and anxiety i've been holding for these months. Without them, who am i today? I wonder if i didnt move to other CSS class i wouldn't meet Sharmaine or others at all.. Dang, what an events of luck really.. Butterfly effect playing on my faith again.

Yknow, its kinda a nice story plot that has a human butterfly as both the villain and savior of the main character, she switches both good and bad events to the main character, and confuse the main character whether she is actually a good or bad person.

That being said, i think this is all i could write, goodnight!!
