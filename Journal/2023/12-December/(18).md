Day 4/19
4:01 AM

Honestly, conducting this offline vacation, I feel a little bit uncomfortable, what did they message? Are they important?

I'm pretty sure its not, but things can wait. I did this offline vacation for a reason. 

Truth is, sharmaine messaged in our group chat, unsure but she mentioned me. 

5:06 AM

I got myself into hell again, or perhaps, a purgatory.

6:20 AM

## A little reminder to myself

Its just been day 4 and its insane how much derailment has happened in this vacation

11:55 AM

Man, this cold ass weather makes me want to sleep

5:24 PM

Its been raining nonstop in afternoon, just laying down in my bed feels so depressing as hell.

I want to do something.

9:27 PM

I feel lonely, so I broke a rule.

And I realized two things, I don't need to be lonely, I need friends.
But friends are only worth for short the, they can't be dependence for long term.

I only have myself in long term, I am the only one who can help myself. If I wanted yo Change then I am the only one who can change. I have enough ability to change what I am today. And not compare myself to others but compare myself from who I am yesterday.

The passion of learning huh..
