Mhm, finally a proof that this personality is not working to this environment at all. Guess i gotta readjust at all. 

Having the greatest chaotic mental breakdown yesterday, i feel slightly better now.

Yesterday i met up with an old classmate whos close to me. I can't believe he actually showed up lol, it was suppose to be a dumb joke that he took seriously lmao. 

**8:31 AM**

I feel slightly off the board. 
Honestly, i might just kill myself in no time. This things happening to me feels like, too much for me to handle. I want to die. 
I don't know what to do, i'll just harm myself to keep myself alive. No, physically hurting myself is a form of discipline to myself. I need to discipline myself. I must become empty. I want to feel nothing. I want to die.

I'll just do my best to live, i dont really care about everyone at this point. Apathy is eating me so bad it kills me hopefully.

I've been thinking about moderating my voice, legitimately my voice sucks as hell thanks to my height, i sound like a dickhead gayass nigger

It makes me think sometimes whether i was a bad person or a good. Maybe i'm both the latter if i get a consensus of many people.
