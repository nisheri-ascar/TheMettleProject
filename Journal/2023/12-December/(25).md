MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

I can't believe I've been writing this journal for 5 months now, and next year will be almost there. Insane.

I want to talk about how I feel these days.

I feel shit, like very very shit.
I always get myself into pleasure hell, but I get now why. 

Its because I adjusted my values.

I already adjusted it to something avoiding to lie, which works and this I'd already the sign it works, it feels shit because in my mind I'm still using the old metrics. I've toned down my lying and I feel slightly better in some situations. I have also managed to control to limit what I enjoy. Because once I get over the limit I will feel shit because I'm wanting that more of happiness.

For now, I need to move forward, I will definitely feel shit but I need to endure and just keep what I'm doing so I could be successful. 

I also need to get back on the game, I will create a task list and tackle it all. 

But for now, I need some decent sleep because finally after those almost sleepless nights I can be finally mentally stable. The effect of having less sleep makes the syntomes of depression and anxiety makes it worse. Gratitude is the key always.

Goodnight
