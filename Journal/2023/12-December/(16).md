## Anxiety attacks

It took long for me to realize what has been happening to me was Anxiety attacks. Occurring to long and it becomes a mental breakdown and derealization. It happens more than multiple times a day, making it no wonder why I feel so shit this past months really. 
I have already considered consuming [Xanax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam) but I don't think they sell it over the counter. The other thing I could use as a coping mechanism is Mint. A plant mint, I might plant again somewhere near our house since last time I planted it it didn't work well.
Mint can be good a coping mechanism I guess, its scene can calm me down. Somewhere during my research showed that Lavander is recommended but I think mint works for me really.
That being said, I need to always remind myself to recognise panic attacks. It can happen literally any time at anywhere.

## Offline Vacation

My phone died, and so its already Christmas Break. I took leverage of both to have my Good Offline Vacation, well not full offline, but just staying away from social medias and crap. I think its a good way to figure things out how to unfuck my life. Specifically my beliefs, values and the way I act apon others. This moment could be my saving grace, as I figured out my rotten nature, all I need to do left is to figure out and take action towards improvement. 
I'll take this Offline Vacation too to return to my good old planned hobbies, drawing, piano, programming. Hell yeah. 

## Balancing Everything

Speaking of hobbies, as always, I need to balance everything, thats just the core law of this universe, no more or less than, both needs to be balanced. I need to balance both my Work/Play force. If I Work too much then down to Kristofer's hell, if I play too much then down to Pleasure Hell straight. I need to be both in order to keep myself sane.

I can't write much anymore, its almost 11 and I still need to attend church tommorow, goodnight!
