I'm thinking of writing a small shell script that notes me to drink water, well all apps that runs background on my phone gets killed for no reason. Termux has a wakelock feature which can last compared to apps without wakelock.

It makes me rethink my entire life, i have never recieved an actual deep level emotional understanding, now that my grandmother is dead. Nobody know who i am truly. I know myself, yet i still struggle to be myself truly. Phillipines is such a fucked up place. Critical thinking is dead, people think of external things rather than internal things, people use violence as a weapon towards people to assert control. What is this world, what the fuck is things suppose to be.
