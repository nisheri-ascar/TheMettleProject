I want to prove to my parents they are wrong, I can be better and I will become better in the way thats not inline with their mindset, their mindset doesn't match with me, I'm not saying they're dumb, but our philosophies contradict, i need to live with them in harmony without touching their philosophy, I already felt like shit before when I followed their philosophy. Its time to prove them that I can do it. I want to prove them I AM BETTER.

This isn't just to prove myself, but to revenge. Avenging my grandmother from what she went through with my father. 

I will revenge then with success.

I need consistency in mind. I need to brought up what I have learned in long run.

I need to learn being consistent first, then do my project.

Goal is what have been fueling me in these times. No wonder it feels like I'm missing and my life feels pointless, goal points me into the right direction. But as I have learned in Atomic Habits,  Goal can only lead me, but it can't help me. So I must create systems and stick with it.
