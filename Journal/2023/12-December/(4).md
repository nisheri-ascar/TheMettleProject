I still can vividly remember my first day in Grade 10 when i was back in SAAMI, i can remember all of my anxieties, reminiscing all of my worries and sadness back in my 9th grade. I had the most terrible experience when i was in my 9th Grade. We were in church that time, first person i saw during the mass was her. I saw her being miserable. I could see her in me. We were both miserable afterall.
