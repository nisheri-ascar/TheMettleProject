istg if diorom dies then we cant make the multimillion crypto mining project anymore, flash context: there's a possible tsunami after the earthquake. I just somehow feel an uneasiness and anxiety. Maybe i'm just scared what will be the future will be. But hell we've been surviving for too long. There's no way people can't go out through this.

Meanwhile that happened, i decided to change my profile picture

I feel like i've developed too much confidence that it turned into an toxic egocentrism. I feel like i have become too much selfish beyond reason. This way i can finally put back myself and keep myself on track towards improvement.

**5:46 AM**

i'm still overwhelmed from what happened last night, a person in our group chat is near vicinity of coastal area where tsunami is possible threat. And now i don't know how things are. I'll just watch in the news later on.

## Sleep Cycle
Turning our topic to my sleep cycle, not gonna lie i feel fine compared to my yesterday sleep. Hans was right about sleep cycle where if you wake up once in a night then you'll have the shittiest sleep ever. I need to find out how to have a decent sleep and set a sleep schedule.

## Journaling Definitely helped
Its been 3 days since i took journaling seriously once again, and i can really tell that its helping me. I can keep track of my thoughts and i find myself lessing my maladaptive daydreaming. I find myself becoming mentally healthier and yeah.

My thoughts are less chaotic and i can focus better

A lil bit brilliant idea i have but about booting arch linux in my potato, what i just instead of making an initramfs from scratch i'll alter the default `init` script instead. That way i don't have to suffer trial and error doing crap. I'll try it right now

**10:07 AM** 

I need to focus, i will finish this. 
I'll finish the portfolio, i'll make the list right here

in the end i didnt do much, well i progressed but its just 1%, no need t be harsh to myself, just going to be chill for now since the weather just feels makes me want to sleep. Besides that my eyes feels tired, might want to give myself a lil bit sleep and continue my work later on

I once again has deluded myself to this false reality again, often i imagine about having a better life in past. I reallt wish i was better in the past but, what happened has already happened. Only i could do really is just to be in present. It sucks to lurk down my past but hell.

I have drowned myself with pleasure too much, i need some fresh air. 

YouTube might turn into an addiction just like facebook.

Man i fucking need a circle of friends who actually cares about their grades, holy fuck of all people i asked dont entirely know what the hell we were supposed to do in our MAPEH portfolio. 

That proves i really need to be self-dependent. If i want to ace this school year then i gotta take note of things seriously. Christ

Aftershocks happened just few minutes ago, i'm such a paranoid person for panicking like a coward, i guess this is an effect for having less sleep. 

I can feel my motivation to write journal is wearing off. Discipline and consistency will come to play and i will prove that i have developed this habit.

What my father said is still lingering in my head. It pisses me off but that's what the truth is. I jumped one instrument to another, shouldve practiced my *organ* (not gonna call it piano from now on). It sucks but hell i need to endure it, i must be thankful too atlease i have this keyboard than none.
