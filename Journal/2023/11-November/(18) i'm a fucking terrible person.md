I finally did it, i became honest. I knew it, it was all inside my head all along. 
Today we're in good terms, before i really thought she hated me. She was someone who i've had emotional dependency way back before. I had my toughest times back when i avoided her so bad like a rodent. 

But in pure honesty, i was shy and scared. I was making too much conclusion of our situation. Thus my cowardness fueled up and avoided her more and more. Hell who wouldnt be scared on how her beauty hasnt fade ever since grade 4?!? She became much of a beauty that it just feels like i've sinned just staring at her. My god, i might be obssesed with her all along. Maybe thats the truth, no that's entirely the truth. But now, in pure genuiness i don't have feelings to her anymore. I can just see her as a friend from the past. Heck.

I ran out of options after i decided to left out Galaw for our Intramurals. So i went to what the average society would fall down. Being a waterboy, i thought it will become an unpleasant experience, **but it was entirely different experience.** Like holy shit really its like we've been blessed by something. All we did was to entirely eat and sleep.
