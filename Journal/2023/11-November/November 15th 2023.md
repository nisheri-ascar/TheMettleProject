I want to write every pain i have on me. And find the way to solve it.

My first and foremost issue, Shanie. I dont have balls to even look at her face. I feel alot of things just seeing her. Excitement, insecurity, many levels of despair. I feel so awful just seeing her. It overwhelmed me to the point i cant do anything but just run away. Its not like i have feelins to her. It already faded long time ago. Its just my head is keeping me from this deluded fictional thoughts (that's entirely different from having a geniuene feelings).
