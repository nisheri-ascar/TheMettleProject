Today is fiesta for maramag, i was really looking forward to be with my friends but unfortunately none of them appeared. Sharmaine tried to but she cant go alone in this house for obvious reason.

Food just doesn't taste the same without people really. It taste so disgusting for whatever reason. It taste horrifying. I dont even have an appetite to eat. Spaghetti tasted horrible too.

I need to pin down my sadness

First and foremost, i'm frustrated that I don't write often in this journal, alot has seriously been happening lately and yet I missed writing those important memory. 

I know for the fact that writing these memories are far the most important thing to do as its the only way to revisit timeless memories. Yet even now i feel the surge of impulse exit writing this and. Fuck i lost my track of words. Christ. 

I need to make journal writing a habit again, i lost it in just a month.

Haha very funny past self, such a dickhead not even filling the link even once.

![[Journal/2023/09-September/(23)#^9c9b94]]

Hah, this dickhead never made it happen. 

[[Journal/2023/09-September/(25)]] was sure peak of my sanity being burned to ashes.

Hm, i thought there was some small downcurve happening in my progress writing these journal entries, guess not. I thought there was some external forces stopping me from writing journal, but nope. Nada. Its just me, and a slope of up and down. I just hava horrible time those days. But hell man, alot, alot has seriously happened. Intrams, friends, and shit. I want to write everything down yet i feel so unmotivated. Why? I need to fix this frustration of "Cant Write journal". I need to be strict about it and enforce myself. I gotta make journaling more than a habit. An alternative to social media egojerking. 

Till tommorow. Self remidner to delete lite for now till you actually need it. Throw all your tantrums here in this journal not in facebook. People cant help you unfortunately, only you. Should wrote a manual too on survival lol.

I wonder if it possible to make journal taking addictive like social media.. hmmmm. Maybe with aesthetics? Just like i did before in my notebooks? Oh yeah thats the entire point why i wanted to design my math notebook, i could be motivated as hell. 

Akiyoshi-san. That's what i'm naming you. It means blessing. Perfect

Akiyoshi-san, remind me that beauty motivates me. Hell yeah.

I noticed personally for addiction to happen, i just need to start it, once i get feed from the *good feeling* i just repeat it. To stop it is sort of hard, it needs some sort of external event to be affected. And that is how my life torn down appart in just a week. All of my practiced habbit and mindset gone in just shit hapened.

Waking up early, jogging, leeping myself busy, i need to pick up those habits again. On the run i need to rebuild my ideal self. Not just for me but for the goodness of everyone else. 

My ideal self:

* Handsome (ofcourse)
* Is disciplined
* Can do tasks right away
* is healthy in terms physically
* mentally well

As mentioned in atomic habits (yes im currently reading this one)

> Decide the type of person you want to be. 
   Prove it to yourself with small wins.

All i need is to *fake it till you make it* thing.

I start an ideal habit, repeat it many times as possible as i can. Then i can prove it on long run. It might suck really but i need to force myself, and thats where **reminders on why you did this** i need to create an oddly specific letter for myself, writing an entire essay why i want to achieve one thing. I hope that stupid idea that just popped of in my head helps

I need to sleep though
