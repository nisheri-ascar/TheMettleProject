Today, i decided to become an average person. 

I don't need to be special for anybody, what i need to be special is make myself feel special. By taking care of myself, by taking care of people that really matters to me.

I won't delude myself anymore from ideas of me saving the world nor becoming popular. I just want peace and averageness.
