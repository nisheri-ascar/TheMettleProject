This early morning, i was still over the clouds about Shanie. 
We had a parade in our school for our intramurals. I saw her many many times in just an span of an our. It was very unsual for my senses, i only get to see her maybe once or twice during in recess. 

During the parade, i got to be in close with her for the first time. I somehow managed to hold her hands. I went away.

# The Liar

I wanted to avoid the awkwardness so much with Krystelle after what i did. So i started a topic, about Shanie and Nerhyz, shouldn't have done that really. But atlease i dodged a bullet, i forgot that Krystelle had a fling with this one guy anfd i fucking forgot. Christ really.
