## Live at the present

Unfortunately for a silly person like me, i like to wander around the past and the future instead of caring of what i actually have in the present. The source of anxiety is being scared what the future holds, the source of depression is holding the past. Having both anxiety and depression is living the worse way possible.
Present is always the only time i could do and control, **focus on the present.**

## Find joy in small things

Sometimes I am focused at the output of what i am doing, its entirely wrong and my flame of motivation runs off quickly. By finding joy in small things I can feel victorious at small things, and this keeping the motivation of fuel up.
