It was too much for me to process.

This morning. I was just going out normally with friends to buy snacks during our recess, i bought ice tea. And then we went back inside to our campus.
My friend, wanted to buy something in campus canteen, so i followed. And there, i was suprised with a beautiful angel spacing out outside in the canteen, i felt my heart heavily pounding. I tried to ignore her as usual, and then we went outside.

Almost when we are back at our room, somebody called my name

"KARL!!"

I turned my head behind me and saw the angel smiling at me, waving her hands.
It didn't register to me quickly what was happening. Did she just call my name? Did she finally acknowledged my presence?

I waved back to her, as if normally I was just waving back to an old friend.
It didn't felt normal, and i finally understood what i felt, *"did she just call my name?" This can't be happening!*

Realizing what happened, i ran off to our room and my entire world fell. For the first time i was romantically... whats the word?
