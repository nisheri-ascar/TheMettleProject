I am so fucking back, and i will write long

## The downfall

After those things happened, the expellation, the isolation, and physical abusing. Everything of me shattered in pieces. What i practiced for so long has gone in obscurity in just a week. It was mind fucking and the worse hell i had in my life. Those times felt so long. 

## What went wrong? And how it became wrong?

Thanks to those times of isolation and ofcourse lack of phone that least limited how i cope so much from maladaptive daydreaming, my delusion already had comforted me so bad. It was what my runaway copium at that time. **in simpler sense isolation caused me to delude myself and resort to imagination**

My worse enemy, [[Maladaptive Daydreaming]]. It has once already eaten me and yet here i am at it again. It was thanks to the hellish domino effect it caused.

## Broken mental infastructure

It shattered into pieces, my systemic way of thinking, the logic and discipline i mad for myself. Gone in just a week of isolationism. Whether i like it or not **i am an extrovert**. I find energy by conneting to people, i can be better with people. I have already utilized that vulnerability of mine back when i was leading the group, it was powerful enough to change who i am. Yet today, iam back to square zero. I need to take action. 

I have already forgotten too that **there are two things to do to do a thing**. One is to reject Indulging the impulse and second is to accept the thing you want to do and do t all with your heart.

## The return

Here i am, back from the ground, i promise you that i will rise again. I will fly through the sky and become the best of the best person i can. I promise to do the dream i wanted to be. And that is to change the world. I will change the world by harnessing the knowledge i have and will be learned. No matter how life gets worse i will keep striving, i will keep striving for everyone. I will sacrifice my present self for my future self. 

And to you my future self, i wish you a luck, i will endure these suffering for you to be in that position. And do your best to change the world. Treat me some beer later ey ;)

## What i have learned.

I learned that no matter how life gets worse, everyhing will have a better place forward, but that doesnt mean that after that everything will continue to be fine. No, at some point you need to be ready how will things couldve gone down in just an instant. It was a deliberate mistake of mine after being told that i was being expelled i became soft as hell. You need to be ready when time comes. 

Another thing is, never forget who you were or what the values you learned. I heavily forgot those things i learned from the past. They were a valuable lesson i couldve used to become a better person

## The future.

Today, i have 3 due assignments, and i have 3 days left. I will do my best from now on, and remember all the lessons, and remember to live through my philosophy. 
It will be rougher than back when i was in saami, people are incompetent. But i will be a good compitent person. I will aim for atlease top 10 for now, no need to aim higher least for now, i need to learn how to get through things and work on it. 


I am so fucking back, i'm so sorry if i didnt write. I promise you i wont leave you alone again. Till in next page.
