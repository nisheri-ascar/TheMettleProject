In just a mere second, everything couldve change.

5:09 PM

It was just a normal afternoon, we went home as usual, and i mean usual the usual. My dad being pissed, tight seat. It was what i used to.

At that time, the only thing i had in my head was, shanie, nothing else. I'm still overthinking that time what if she hates me. But in reality she didnt, i came to that conclusion but i will explain later.

I was watching many sceneries disappear as our motorcycle move faster, i wanted to go home and do things i want to do. 
In sudden moment, i notice a dog slowly walking through the road we were taking. It felt something was wrong, what the hell? 
We were speeding, and in just a split second we could hit the dog. I shouted "DOG!!" And my father took breaks, we were only an meter away from the dog, it was that moment i knew and understood if my father didnt breaked then our lives drastically changed. But it didnt occur to me until later on. After saving ourselves in just a second, a split second later, a motorcycle from behind us, hit the dog and the driver flew few meters beyond. I heard the horror of the dog having its most painful experience it had in life and a motor metal screeching. I never saw what happened afterwards, but i could imagine the bloody scenery. We almost died, our lives couldve change drastically in just a mere second. Everything at that present just became a possible turning point through a most horrific future.

Going home, the sceneryof our house felt so refreshing. Taking care of the animals felt more meaningful somehow. The backyard scenery felt like new scenery to my eyes. I knew that if shit really happened then it wouldve be more different. 

I learned things.

Those things i've become anxious, it doesnt really matter. Something really worse can happen that those small things i became anxious to, theyre just small things that can be solved by taking action. Me almost dying was certainly something beyond my control. But shanie's feelings is still something i couldve do to. And i will do it.
