I had the most strangest dream again. Its related to my expellation in school. Cant remember the entire scenery though. 

I realized one thing, dreams are an alternative universe or reflection of your day to day life.

And to be honest, i miss everything in San Andres. The early morning i would greet "Good morning" to my friends, Johanna would often ask me something related to assigment before going to sit. After sitting i'd have a small talk with people either at my back or in front. Finally in morning ceremonies, i miss having to stand atlease an hour, and singing the andresian hymm and reciting andresian values, and the absurdity of people listening to my awful voice (they had to swallow it). I missed all of my classmates being stuck outside since the one who was assigned for the keys was absent. I miss asking angela my seatmate when i have difficulty understanding the subject, she was cool and silent. I miss asking Ciara and Glyzel in front of me for an absurd jokes i tell them. I miss looking at back and watch Monique being pissed as i annoy her. I miss asking our English teacher for clarification in our subject, she was a great explainer and connects with the student, she was literally peak teacher you'll ever have. I miss the absurd seating arrangement in our classroom during filipino time, but thanks to that i can speak with many people.
