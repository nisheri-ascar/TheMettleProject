i can feel an intense void eating me, the loneliness is eating me again.

i never wanted to be lonely, i never wanted to be lonely. i feel like everything is going worser. please kill me already.
i expected thst i would be transfered immediately, turns out i wont be transfered till 21. goddamned this.

my loneliness will eat me.

no, i need to keep my spirits up. i cant die, everybody is waiting for me
