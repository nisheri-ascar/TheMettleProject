Looks like i need to rewrite something i forgot to write back then?
There's this CGP thing in our class, homeroom guidance thing, basically its like teaching us how to be disciplined and stuff. And its asked which moment that made me completely feel achieved. That moment i could far recall is when we did filipino roleplay, i feel so satisfied that i regained my confidence that time. So i'll write the answer here.
