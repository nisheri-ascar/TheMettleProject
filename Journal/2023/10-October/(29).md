Finally learning to guitar, i switched to regular guitar since my keyboard already got pissed me off. The keys were small enough for my fingers so it was hard to move around the keyboard and click the proper certain keys. Maybe one day i get proper keyboard and relearn using piano. But for now i will focus on guitar to also train my ear

I'm thankful enough my mother knows how to guitar, its easier for me to navigate learning. Maybe the one that made learning piano difficult is no one actually uses it around me, so i cant really relate and have an idea how to use a piano. But thank God really, she already has a navigation for my learning.
