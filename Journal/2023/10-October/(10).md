My arms sore as hell, father went all out and punched the hell out of me. I didn't really cry or anything, I didn't cared it happened either. 

Action is needed, not emotion. That's my general philosophy, but today there's nothing I can do, even joining to some activities, I couldn't since I already passed first grading in San Andres.

I already made a good impression in the school, particularly in the classroom. Seems like we could go along well I guess.

It's kinda insane
