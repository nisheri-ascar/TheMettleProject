As a nature lover, I approve. In San Andres there's barely trees due to small space. It's kinda sad that San Andres has small space, pretty sure if they had big land their teaching and student experience would be pleasing. They're pretty limited in terms of rooms they have. 

Anyways, the announcements are way hella long here, and the fuckton students and awful space here is killing me, it's insanely tight as fuck here ![[VID_20231016_074309.mp4]]

Like bro, I can smell sweaty armpits and the lines are fucking mixed, mygod.

I can't help but notice the differences of this school. It's insane. But hey, this is public school were talking about.

Yooo new classmates.
I actually feel much more in place compared to our classroom. The girl beside me is talkative as hell, she gives me a vibe of aquilla back in San Andres.

It feels refreshing honestly. To walk on my way home is far the most refreshing thing i could do after a long day of school, its so so pleasing. Its like a little warmup. Back then we would immediately ride motor. Ahh what has nature given to me.

#### "Ka bright ba nimo whsahsahshas"

It was the common word i hear often, but i dont want to get cocky. There's this one girl before going home, she told me how smart i was. Often i would brag about it but i tried to change my ways. Instead i told her that she can feel free to ask me a question if she had difficulty understanding the topic. I don't want to restrict my knowledge to others. I want to help others cultivate their knowledge.
