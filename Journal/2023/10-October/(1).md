wow, its already october, i cant believe it.

my entire september was both full of joy and suffering. i only lasted for two months in SAAMI. 

i dont know what to expect in this month, im sure it will be suffering. even though im already tired from what september has given me i'll try to continue the best person i envisioned to become.

i will become the better version of who i am today, this is just a challenge of god, everything will be fine at some point.

it will be okay. things will be okay, it will be okay, it will be okay, it will be okay, it will be okay, it will be okay, it will be okay, it will b okay it will.

tommorow will be i'll be transfered. i feel anxious honestly but thanks to phia i got it out.

speaking of phia, i wasnt wary. she's apparently a friend of shanie. maybe bff, but they got a pic of each other. its the most unexpected crossover i ever encountered.
