I got depressed not long time ago this day, i found the answer why. Internet was designed to allow others to communicate. But it became a hell for distractions and evil. It *was* designed with good intent in mind, but unfortunately it was too good that evil made advantage of it. And that's where i'm currently in. I regretted indulging distractions when i could just, do what actually matters. I hated myself so bad, but now i have hold of the laptop again, i will ensure i will do what matters and important. I will get back right on track again.

## Well, what were you cookin in previous days?

I'm really really sorry i skipped writing, alot of ~~procrastination~~ things happened. I'll try to sort things up in chronological order.

### I got back to Coding again

Its good that i got my coding skills warmed up. Since i'm planning to take Computer Science major in BNSHI (a school), its convinient that i can do coding already, not really sure if there's coding but hey, its better to be ready. Above the picture is a simple rock, paper and scissors game, its not entirely finished yet but check out [[TODO LIST NIGAAA]] to check for things to be done.

### Graphic Design thingzz

Yep, i made this one. It was entirely painful to use GIMP, i got used to pixelab that just tailored what i need, which ofcourse i was proud to make [it.](Journal/2023/08-August/(11))   
(it was painful to link the thing above too.)

### Fiesta!!

Yep, my friends got into my house, it was fiesta and, while they didnt last that long i finally got to see them after that long hell of things happened. I missed how silly our conversations was, i missed them so bad. God i wished i didn't get expelled. I truly enjoyed my classmates this year, they were the realest of all realest. They were the first high school classmates i had that never judged me, they were the first that never hated me, they were the first that truly embraced who i am. They were the one who helped me to reshape my confidence again. And words wasnt enough to tell them how i'm so damned thankful to them. 

But i know what already happened already happened. I need to keep looking forward, and keep my heads up

### What now? What do you plan in your path's future??

Today, there's nothing much i can really do except keep myself sane as possible, i still have 11 days left before going back again to school. And i can feel my mental health detoriating thanks to isolation.

And honestly, i can still feel some anxiety clinging on me, what if the room i'll be transfered to will be toxic? What if something goes wrong?

but as great aristotle said

> We immensely suffer in our imagination than in reality.

in other words, its just inside my head. All i need to do afterwards is just to give them a decent first impression of me, first impression last they say.

well, i guess thats all.. see ya next time.
