It has already October, and my head can't still fend off the vague feeling, the uncertainty, the anxiety. What does my future hold really? I know I can change the course of my life by taking action but the things i can't control. Last thing that made me suffer so much had the biggest impact in my life. 3 weeks felt like it has been a year. Now that i'm in other school, i feel fine and comfortable but, there's just still something in me, i'm scared what others can do to me and at the same time i'm scared what i can do to others. What if i done it again? I know for myself i'm a terrible person.
Since I forgot to journal all things happened, i will write it by now.

#### Maybe it isn't bad to be here at all
